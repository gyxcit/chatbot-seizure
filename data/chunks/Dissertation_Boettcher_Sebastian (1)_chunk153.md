InreflectivePPGmeasurements,alight-emittingdiode(LED)shineslighttowardtheskin,
and a photoelectric sensor records the amount of reflected light, modulated by the different
light absorption rates of the tissue at the recording location [162] and the blood during a
typical pulse wave cycle [163]. While green light has a lesser optical penetration depth than
redandinfraredlight[164],shorterlightwavelengthsalsohaveahigherabsorptioncoefficient
in blood [165], resulting in a higher signal-to-noise ratio with respect to monitoring blood
volume in tissue. Thus, green LEDs are generally considered a better alternative to red ones
