Monitoring epilepsy patients is a necessary clinical tool not only to diagnose and treat
individuals, but also to develop new avenues of treatment (Section 2.1). While some possibil-

they are typically short-term, cumbersome, and intrusive. Wearables on the other hand are
much less burdensome, but still lack in seizure detection performance. Further, patients’ and
