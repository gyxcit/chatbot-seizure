EEG devices, and ambulatory EEG systems, offering non-invasive monitoring options [11,12]. These
innovations enable the development of improved prediction systems and alarm mechanisms to aid patients
in predicting and managing seizures effectively [12]. Wearable devices leveraging cardiorespiratory signals
have demonstrated promising results in seizure prediction, achieving high levels of sensitivity and
specificity through real-time monitoring [12]. Furthermore, machine learning techniques have been
integrated into wearable seizure detection systems to enhance detection quality, surpassing existing real-
