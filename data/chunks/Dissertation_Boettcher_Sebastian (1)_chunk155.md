a baseline before the next pulse starts [171]. Figure 2.4 shows the BVP signal in detail. The
heart rate (HR) is thereby directly and accurately derivable from the peak to peak intervals
between single systolic peaks. Depending on the circumstances and properties of the sensor,
a lower-frequency component attributed to the breathing frequency of the subject may also
modulate the raw signal [172]. Some sensors and devices, however, may immediately filter
out this signal component and not include it in the output data. The PPG signal may also
