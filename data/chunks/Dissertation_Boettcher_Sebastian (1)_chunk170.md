compiling their capabilities and evidence of performance, if available [122]. Furthermore, re-
cent reviews of studies predominantly evaluating convulsive TCSs have shown that mobile
health devices are a promising method for epilepsy monitoring especially in out-of-hospital
contexts (Figure 2.5) [108, 109, 121, 213]. However, while there are a number of studies eval-
uating the performance of focal seizure (FS) detection, there still is a lack of evidence for a
