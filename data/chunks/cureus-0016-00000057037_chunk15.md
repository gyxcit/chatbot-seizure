remarkable sensitivity and specificity levels [11]. These prediction systems enhance the proactive
management of epilepsy by enabling early identification of potential seizure episodes. Complementing
prediction and alarm systems embedded within wearable devices contributes to heightened monitoring
capabilities. Ethernet body-worn motion sensors, for instance, are engineered to detect motion
abnormalities in epileptic patients, furnishing an additional layer of monitoring and alerting functionalities
[11]. Wearable devices represent a paradigm shift in epilepsy management, significantly advancing patient
