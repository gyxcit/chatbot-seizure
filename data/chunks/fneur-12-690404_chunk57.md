reported seizure times (116), and for a subset of people, cycles been often found to precede seizure onset by several minutes
measured from seizure diaries are predictive of the likelihood (127). Billeci et al. found that heart rate variability could be

Machine learning can also be used with historic trends from sensitivity, albeit with a relatively high average false positive
self-reported seizure diaries, which may be useful to forecast rate of 0.41 per hour (almost 10 per day) (128). Signals that
