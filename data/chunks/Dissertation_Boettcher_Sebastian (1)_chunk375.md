values. However, the EDA data and feature values were visibly opposite. This confirms that
the model was trained properly on both the ACC and EDA features and that both modalities
contributed to the modelâ€™s classification of seizure occurrence. Thus, the misclassification of
1 event was due to atypical raw data and confirmed that the model included EDA features in
itsclassification.
A possible explanation for the unusual EDA signal during this seizure could be that the
EDA electrodes lost adequate contact with the skin, and it was not fully re-established after
theseizure. Thiscouldbecausedbyanimproperlywornwearabledevice,oralossofcontact
