synergy between wearable digital health technology and machine learning algorithms in transforming
epilepsy management and facilitating early detection, intervention, and personalized care for individuals
with epilepsy.
Feedback mechanisms for personalized prediction: Wearable devices for seizure prediction have witnessed
significant strides in recent years, particularly in machine learning-based anomaly detection of heart rate
variability (HRV). The wearable epileptic seizure prediction system devised by Yamakawa et al. employs
machine learning algorithms to scrutinize HRV indices, compute T2 and Q values, and identify anomalies
