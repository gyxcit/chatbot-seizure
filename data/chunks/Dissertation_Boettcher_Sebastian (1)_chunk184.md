Munch Nielsen et al. [230] propose a multimodal FS detection and record ECG, ACC, and
behind-the-earEEGfromwearabledevices. Intheiranalysistheauthorsincludedonepatient

Baumgartner et al. [231] extract features from surface EMG signals and use them in an
amplitude analysis threshold detection methodology, detecting TCSs as well as a variety of
different motor FSs. Among the FS types, they could correctly detect 50% of seizures with
