Wearable Devices for Seizure Tracking and Management
Data visualization and analysis tools: The development of data visualization and analysis tools tailored for
wearable technology represents a pivotal step in enhancing healthcare delivery. A notable study focused on
creating CarePortal, a data analytics dashboard designed to visualize and interpret patient wearable data for
clinicians [25]. Using a participatory design with clinicians, researchers crafted an interactive web
application synthesizing symptomatic health data gleaned from wearable smartwatches [25]. Wearable
