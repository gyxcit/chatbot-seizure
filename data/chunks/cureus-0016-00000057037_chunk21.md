can facilitate the automatic detection of various seizure types with high levels of accuracy [15]. These
advancements in wearable digital health technology not only improve the quality of life for individuals with
epilepsy but also contribute to reducing mortality rates associated with epileptic seizures, particularly in
low-resource settings where access to expertise and treatment is limited [19].
