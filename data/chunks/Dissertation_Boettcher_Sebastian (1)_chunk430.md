4.3 Summary
This chapter investigated the detection of convulsive tonic-clonic seizures and related clin-
ical manifestations. Convulsive seizures such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures and focal
to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures are what popular culture typically refers to when portray-
ing an epileptic seizure, and they are among the most high-profile and dangerous seizure
types in terms of their semiology. This, on the other hand, also potentially makes them the
most straightforward to detect using biosignals captured by typical wearable sensors. High-
