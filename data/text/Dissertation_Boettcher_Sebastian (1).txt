E
pilepsie ist eine der am weitesten verbreiteten chronischen neurologischen Erkrankun-
gen, von der weltweit Millionen von Menschen aus allen Gesellschaftsschichten betrof-
fen sind. Epilepsie äußert sich bei den Betroffenen durch wiederkehrende Anfälle mit einer
ReiheunterschiedlicherSymptome,inwechselndenAbständenundmitvariablerAusprägung.
Der Goldstandard zur Diagnose und Beobachtung von Epilepsie ist die Video-Elektroenze-
phalografie. DabeiwerdenEpilepsiepatienteneinigeTagelangüberwachtwährendÄrztemit

Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wurde ein neuer Datensatz von Biosignaldaten erstellt und ver-

Ein zentraler Teil dieser Arbeit befasst sich mit krampfartigen tonisch-klonischen An-
fällen, also schweren und gefährlichen Anfällen die in beiden Gehirnhälften beginnen oder
sich dorthin ausbreiten. Während dieser Anfälle ist das Bewusstsein des betroffenen Patien-
tenbeeinträchtigtundeskommtzuhochamplitudigen,hochfrequentenZuckungenderGlied-
maßen und am gesamten Körper. In einer der hier vorgestellten Studien wurde eine automa-
tische Erkennungsmethode auf Grundlage einer Kombination aus Beschleunigungsmessung
und elektrodermalen Aktivitätssignalen bewertet. Ein maschinelles Lernmodell wurde auf
Experten-markierten Daten trainiert und anhand einer dem Modell unbekannten Testgruppe
bewertet. Die Leistung des Modells ist mindestens gleichwertig mit dem Stand der Technik,
beieinerkorrektenErkennungvonüber90ProzentderAnfallsereignisseundeinerFehlalarm-
rate von weniger als 0,5 Prozent pro Tag. Die vorgeschlagene Methodik schneidet außerdem
besser ab als das durchschnittliche monomodale Erkennungssystem aus vergleichbaren Stu-
dien. Auf konvulsive tonisch-klonische Anfälle folgt in der Regel eine Phase der Bewegungs-
und Bewusstlosigkeit, wodurch das Risiko eines plötzlichen unerwarteten Todes bei Epilep-
sie erheblich erhöht ist. Eine weitere Studie untersucht die Brauchbarkeit von am Körper
gemessenen Biosignaldaten, um diesen Zeitraum der Bewusstlosigkeit mithilfe einer heuris-
tischenErkennungbasierendaufBeschleunigungssignalenzuerkennenundeinzuschätzen. In
Abhängigkeit von einer vorherigen automatischen Erkennung des Anfalls war die Methode

Ein weiterer wesentlicher Teil dieser Arbeit befasst sich mit der Erkennung fokaler An-
fälle anhand von Daten aus Wearables. Fokale Anfälle haben, über verschiedene Patienten
hinweg betrachtet, typischerweise sehr heterogene Symptome. Diese umfassen verschiedene
Arten von Körperbewegungen, Reaktionen des autonomen Nervensystems und psychologis-
che Veränderungen. In der hier einbezogenen Forschung wurden nur solche fokalen Anfälle
mitspezifischenBewegungenderGliedmaßenanalysiert. EineersteexplorativeStudieunter-

lage der vom Wearable aufgezeichneten Biosignale untersucht. Die Studie ergab, dass die op-
tischgemessenenBlutvolumenpulsdatenstarkdurchBewegungsartefaktebeeinträchtigtsind.
Darüber hinaus schnitten generische Modelle deutlich schlechter ab als patientenspezifische
Modelle und wiesen hohe Fehlalarmraten auf. Daher sind für die Erkennung fokaler Anfälle
maßgeschneiderte Erkennungsmodelle für einzelne Patienten, und zwar speziell für eine Un-
tergruppe von Epilepsiepatienten bei denen charakteristische Anfälle auftreten, wahrschein-
lichdierobustesteMethode.
Diese Arbeit kommt zu dem Schluss, dass generische Anfallserkennungsmodelle zwar
für hoch-konvulsive Anfälle und unter Krankenhausbedingungen ausreichend sein können,
dass sie aber derzeit nicht für die Erkennung fokaler Anfälle mit weniger oder gar keinen
Bewegungen geeignet sind. Umgekehrt sind patientenspezifische Erkennungsmethoden für
nicht-konvulsivemotorischeAnfällevielversprechend. Erkennungsmodelle,diesichimLaufe

E
pilepsy is one of the most prevalent chronic neurological disorders, affecting millions
worldwide throughout all societal groups. Epilepsy manifests in those affected as reoc-
curring seizures with a wide range of different symptoms at variable intervals and severity.
Thecurrentgoldstandardtodiagnoseandmonitorepilepsyisvideo-electroencephalography.
Patients with epilepsy visit monitoring units for a few days, and clinicians provoke seizures
through various means, hoping to get enough information for precise diagnosis and treat-
ment. However, this procedure is not viable during the patients’ daily lives and over more
extended periods. Furthermore, the handwritten diaries that some patients keep have proven
unreliable, typically severely under-counting the number of seizures occurring. An alterna-
tiveforultra-long-termmonitoringisneededtoimprovecurrenttreatmentsandfacilitatethe
developmentofnewtherapyoptions. Thisthesisinvestigatesthepotentialofmultimodalnon-
electroencephalography data recorded from wearable devices as a tool for seizure detection
in the context of automated seizure diaries. It furthermore explores a potential application of
seizuredetectioninthecontextofanautomaticalarmsystem.
Theworkfeaturedinthisthesisproducesandemploysanewdatasetofwearablebiosig-
naldata,recordedattwoEuropeanepilepsycentersinthecontextofaEuropeancollaborative
research project. Over 200 patients with epilepsy were recruited at the two epilepsy moni-
toring units, and over 300 epileptic seizures of varying types were recorded with a wearable
device. Here, the Empatica E4 is used, a research-grade wrist-worn wearable that captures
the biosignal modalities of accelerometry (movement), electrodermal activity (electrical skin
conductance), and blood volume pulse (optical pulse measurement via photoplethysmogra-
phy). Thisdatasetwasthebasisforseveraldataanalysisstudiesconcerningtheevaluationof

This thesis compiles and provides a framework for several contributions of the author
concerning the detection of epileptic motor seizures with multimodal non-electroencepha-
lography data from wearables. Specifically, the included studies investigated those seizures
withmovementmanifestationsinthelimbsandfounddetectionsystemsbasedonsupervised
ensemblemachinelearningusingphysiologicalbiosignaldatatobeviable.
One central part of this thesis is focused on convulsive tonic-clonic seizures, severe and
dangerous seizures that start in or progress to both hemispheres of the brain. During these
seizures, the awareness and consciousness of the affected patient are impaired, and high-am-
plitude,high-frequencyjerksofthelimbsandwholebodyoccur. Oneofthestudiespresented

here assessed an automatic detection methodology based on a combination of accelerometry
and electrodermal activity signals. A supervised ensemble machine learning model is trained
on expert-labeled data and evaluated on an out-of-sample test set. It performs at least on
par with state-of-the-art related work, correctly classifying more than 90 percent of seizure
events with false alarm rates of less than 0.5 per day. The suggested methodology performs
betterthantheaveragemonomodaldetectionsysteminrelatedwork. Convulsivetonic-clonic
seizures are typically followed by a period of unconsciousness and immobility, significantly
increasing the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. A further study investigates the
utilityofwearablebiosignaldatatodetectandgaugethisperiodbasedonaheuristicdetection
using accelerometry signals. Contingent on a prior automatic detection of the seizure, the
methodologywasabletoclassifyallinstancesofimmobilityinthedatasetcorrectly.
Another essential segment of this thesis highlights the detection of focal seizures with
data from wearables. Focal seizures typically have very heterogeneous symptoms when re-
garded across patients. They include body movements of different kinds, responses of the
autonomic nervous system, and psychological indications. The research included here an-
alyzed only those focal seizures with specific movements of the limbs. An early exploratory
studyinvestigatedtheimpactofthehighvarianceoffocalmotorseizuresonbiosignalsandthe
performanceofseizuredetectionbasedonthosesignals. Anadditionalstudythenconsidered
individualized and generic models for detecting focal motor seizures based on the biosignals
recordedbythewearable. Thestudyfoundtheopticallymeasuredbloodvolumepulsedatato
be highly impacted by noise from motion artifacts. Furthermore, generic models performed
considerably worse than those specific to an individual patient, with high false alarm rates.
Thus, for focal seizure detection, custom-made detection models for individual patients are
likelytobethemostrobustmethodology,andarespecificallysuitableforasubsetofpatients
withepilepsywhoexperiencecharacteristicseizures.
This thesis concludes that while generic seizure detection models may be sufficient for
highly convulsive seizures and under in-hospital conditions, they are currently not feasible
for detecting focal seizures with fewer or no movements. Conversely, patient-specific detec-
tion methodologies are promising for non-convulsive motor seizures. Detection models that
individualizeovertimemayeventuallybecomethebestoptionforultra-long-termseizurede-
tection. Specifically, the included studies investigated detection systems based on supervised
ensemble machine learning using physiological biosignal data. Results showed them to be
feasible for detecting convulsive and less-convulsive seizures with manifestations including
movementsofthelimbs.Contents

Epilepsyanditssymptomshavebeenpartofmedicaltextssincethebeginningofrecorded
history [2, 3]. Some of the earliest accounts of apparent epileptic seizures date as far back as
ca. 2000b.c. [4], while epilepsy as a human condition is first described in some early Babylo-
nian medical records, ca. 1000b.c. [3, 4]. The condition was generally regarded as a divine,
spiritual affliction until its first description as a medical disease in On the Sacred Disease, at-
tributed to Hippocrates, ca. 400b.c. [4]. Nevertheless, misunderstanding and stigmatization
of the epileptic condition continued throughout the Middle Ages, and only modern scientific
medicinestartedtoacknowledgeitsneurologicalorigins. Thefirstanticonvulsivemedications
usedinepilepsywereBromidein1857andPhenobarbitalin1912[5]. Sincethen,manydiffer-
entanti-epilepticdrugsandtreatmentshavebeendevelopedandimproved[6]. However,even
today, epilepsy remains a prevalent, albeit often treatable, neurological disorder, and patients
withepilepsy(PWEs)arestillstigmatizedanddiscriminatedagainst[7].
1.1.1 What is Epilepsy?
Epilepsy is clinically defined as a disease generally identified if two unprovoked seizures oc-
curmorethanonedayapartorifthereisareasonablyheightenedriskofsubsequentseizures
after an initial one [8]. The origin of an individual’s epilepsy can be genetic, acquired, or un-
known,andinmanycases,iscausedbyacombinationofthesefactors[9]. Variousconditions
may cause acquired epilepsy, including strokes, tumors, brain trauma, and nervous system
infections[10].
The neurological mechanism of an epileptic seizure is described as the abnormal and un-
controlled firing of neurons in the brain, disrupting the regular and organized brain activity.
Thesourceofthisanomalousactivity,thatis,theseizure,iscalledthefocus,andtheonset and
offset arethestartandendtimesoftheseizure. Thefocusoftheseizurecanbelimitedtoone
specificlocationofthebrain,orspanlargeareasofbothhemispheresofthebrain,describing
focal seizures or generalized seizures, respectively (see also Section 1.1.2). The whole period
of the seizure between onset and offset is called the ictal 1 period, with a typical duration of
a few seconds to many minutes. The onset and offset of the seizure are thereby determined
by clinicians reviewing the electroencephalography (EEG) signal. The periods immediately
precedingandfollowingtheseizurearedenotedpre-ictal andpost-ictal,respectively. Thepre-
ictal phase can include symptoms such as behavioral or cognitive changes [11] and changes
in heart rate (HR) [12]. In the post-ictal phase clinical symptoms of the seizure itself, such as
cognitiveimpairments,oftenremainbeyondtheEEG-offsetoftheseizure.
Thetimefromonepost-ictaltothenextpre-ictalphaseiscalledtheinter-ictal period. Pre-

With a worldwide incidence of up to 100 new cases per 100,000 people per year and af-
fecting over 70 million people worldwide, epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological
disorders[14,15]. Atanygiventime,anestimated4to10per1,000peoplehaveepilepsy,that
is, are at risk of continuing seizures and needing treatment [16]. Epilepsy is more common
in men than in women, in children than in adults, and in low- and middle-income countries
thaninhigh-incomecountries[17]. Furthermore,concerningthethreedifferentiatedepilepsy

1.1.2 Epileptic Seizures
An epileptic seizure is an occurrence of symptoms due to abnormal neuronal activity in the
brain [21]. Epileptic seizures can manifest in various symptoms [22], which can change over
time in individual patients, especially children [23]. The expression of an epileptic seizure as
agroupofsymptomsisalsocalledsemiology 1. Asthemanagementandtreatmentofepilepsy
can vary according to which type of symptoms occur, and some non-epileptic seizures exist,
a classification of seizures into a specific set of categories can be of utmost importance. Over
timetherehasbeenamiscellanyofdifferentseizuretypeclassifications[24–26],withthelatest
being the 2017 Operational classification of seizure types by the International League Against
Epilepsy(ILAE)[27]. However,terminologyfromolderclassificationsissometimesstillinuse.

Themostwidelyandcolloquiallyknownseizuretypeisthatofthegeneralizedtonic-clonic
seizure (GTCS) [28]. As a generalized seizure, it onsets throughout the brain and progresses
from the tonic 1 phase, a brief tensing of skeletal muscles in the limbs and throughout the
body, to the clonic 2 phase with prolonged, violent, and rapid convulsions of the muscles [22].
GTCSs typically last no longer than 1 to 2 minutes, are accompanied by tachycardia 3 and
impaired awareness, and are often followed by a period of unconsciousness [22, 29]. Directly
related to GTCSs are focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (FBTCSs), which have a focal onset

fromGTCSs[30]. Assuch,GTCSsandFBTCSsaremajorriskfactorsconcerningSUDEP[19].
While there are other types of generalized seizures like generalized absences, they are much
lessfrequentinthedatasetsincludedforthisthesisandarenotfurtherdetailedhere.
ContrarytoGTCSsandFBTCSs,focalseizures(FSs)havealocalizedonsetinthebrainand
donotprogressoverbothhemispheres. FSsarelesswell-knowntothepublicthanGTCSs,and
their often less severe manifestations are also not as prevalent in the general media coverage
concerning epilepsy[28]. Nevertheless,they make upa considerableportion ofseizures [15].
They are much more varied in their manifestations than GTCSs, as symptoms can depend
on the localization of the focus in the brain [31]. Seizure classifications generally subdivide
FSs by the awareness status of the patient and the occurrence of motor symptoms during
theseizure[27]. Olderseizureclassificationsdesignatedfocalseizureswithoutimpairmentof
awareness as simple partial seizures, and those where the consciousness is impacted as com-
plexpartialseizures[25]. However,thosenotationsarenotusedanymoreincurrentliterature
in favor of more verbose descriptions of the seizures [32]. Any combination of awareness,
motor,andnon-motormanifestationcanoccurduringthesameseizure.
Among possible variants of FSs, those with tonic or clonic motor features, or both, are
closest to GTCSs concerning manifestation and thus also wearable monitoring. While the
patterns of movement during the ictal phase mimic those during a GTCS, these seizures are
muchlessviolentlyconvulsivethantheirgeneralizedcounterparts. Moreover,theyareusually
not followed by a period of unconsciousness. Overall, possible motor manifestations in FSs
canincludethefollowingfeatures,roughlyorderedbyperceivedseverityofmovement:
Hyperkinetic: Intense, irregular, asymmetric, projecting, and violent movements of one or
more limbs. Vocalization and fear are common non-motor symptoms accompanying
hypermotorseizures[33].
Clonic: Regular and repeated alternation between tensing and relaxing muscles in one or
more limbs. In focal clonic seizures, the patient usually maintains consciousness at
seizureonset[22].
Tonic: Tensing of the muscles of one or more limbs. Tonic features are often a prelude to
moreintenseclonicmovements[22].
Automatism: Regularorcomplexmovementsofaspecificbodypart,whichcanincludethe
limbsorpartsofthelimbs,thehead,themouth,ortheeyelids[22,34].
Myoclonic: Very short single twitch of a body part, often repeated several times in quick
successionwithinjustafewseconds. Theyaremostfrequentlyassociatedwithjuvenile
myoclonicepilepsy,ageneticsyndromeemerginginadolescents[35].
Atonic: Complete, involuntary relaxation of muscles in a part of or the whole body. The
sudden loss of muscle control in atonic seizures substantially increases the risk of in-
jury[36].
A similar array of possible symptoms exists regarding non-motor manifestations of FSs.

seizures are left unclassified, especially in outpatient settings where the seizure was not wit-
nessed by another person or recorded by video. Moreover, even under monitored conditions,

1.1.3 Diagnosis, Monitoring, Management, and Treatment
DiagnosisandMonitoring
Epilepsy can be diagnosed in a clinical ambulatory setting by anamnesis, whereby a patient
visitsaneurologistanddescribespotentialpastseizures,geneticdisposition,orotherrelevant
circumstances that may lead to a diagnosis of epilepsy. Another common way to diagnose
epilepsy and epileptic seizures, sometimes reinforcing findings concluded from anamnesis, is
through differential diagnosis in an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU), usually part of a hos-
pital or medical center for neurological healthcare. The clinical gold standard for epilepsy
monitoringinanEMUisvideo-electroencephalography(vEEG).ThestayinanEMUtypically
ranges between two days and two weeks in duration, depending on the purpose of the visit
and individual needs, although research has shown that the diagnostic yield in EMUs drops
significantlyafterfivedays[50]. InavEEGmonitoringunit,clinicaltechniciansattachastan-
dardarrayofEEGelectrodestothepatient’sscalp,mostoftenina10-20pattern[51,52],and
a video camera is pointed towards the patient’s hospital bed, continuously recording during

allowed to leave the hospital room for a short duration, removing themselves from the vEEG
system. TheEEGandvideodataaremonitoredaround theclockbytechniciansorclinicians,
and the patients have access to an alarm bell that can notify staff of an impending, ongoing,

and (semi-)automatic detection of epileptic activity with EEG is possible, however, it often
requires the patient to wear high-density EEG electrode arrays [55, 56], or have electrodes
implanted [57, 58]. An additional practice of monitoring seizures, especially in an outpatient
context,iskeepingaseizurediaryofmanuallyrecordedoccurrencesofseizuresinthepatient’s
daily life. Systematic and long-term documentation of seizures is essential for therapeutic
decision-making and clinical and pharmacological studies [59, 60]. As the primary aim of
epilepsy treatment is for the patient to become seizure-free, correctly gauging the number of
seizureoccurrencesisparamounttoassessingtheefficiencyofagiventreatment.
ManagementandTreatment
In modern medicine, there are several options to manage and treat epilepsy. Anti-epileptic
drugs (AEDs) can potentially suppress seizures in two out of three PWEs, but they rarely
change the long-term prognosis, which is most affected by epilepsy surgery [14]. In this pro-
cess,vEEGmonitoringunitsareessentialforeffectivelytreatingPWEs. Differentialdiagnosis
and pre-surgical evaluation are the most common reasons to visit an EMU. Patients selected
for a surgical intervention based on their diagnosis undergo pre-surgical evaluation. To bet-
ter understand their seizures in general and gain knowledge about the localization of seizure
onsets to discover potential targets for resection, clinicians provoke seizures in a controlled
environment through different means, such as reduction of AEDs, sleep deprivation, or stim-
ulation with light pulses [61]. During seizures, the patients are cared for by specialized staff
who monitor the seizure manifestation and progression and test for symptoms like muscle
tensingorcognitiveimpairments. Thisinformationmayhelptoidentifytheseizuretypeand
onsetlocalization.
Resective epilepsy surgery is only relevant for patients who are AED-refractory, that is,
who are not responding to AEDs, and for whom clinicians were able to define a focal seizure
onset zone. The aim of the surgery is to potentially reduce or eliminate the recurrence of
seizures [62]. During surgery, brain tissue is removed at the location of typical seizure onset
while carefully weighing a positive outcome for the patient against minimizing the risk of
furtherneurologicaldamage. Onaverage,between25%and50%ofpatientswhounderwent

Adifferentmethodofmanagingandtreatingepilepsyandepilepticseizuresisneurostim-
ulation [64]. Clinicians usually administer this therapy to patients who are AED-refractory
and for whom surgery is not an option. Generally, there are three types of neurostimulation
frequentlyemployedinepilepsypatients.
Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is the oldest type of stimulation and uses an extra-cranial
methodology to stimulate the vagus nerve on a pre-programmed regular schedule. While
VNS can significantly reduce seizure frequency in up to half of the treated population, it has
common side effects like hoarseness and speech modulation, especially during stimulation
phases[64,65].

—SteveMann,1997[70]
A wearable device, or wearable, is a self-sufficient electronic device that can be worn on
the human body in some form. In this thesis wearables are battery-powered devices which
can record at least one sensor modality that represents one of the wearer’s biosignals. While
wearable technology in a broader sense has existed for some hundred years, wearable elec-
tronic computing devices only emerged in the 1970s and 1980s [71]. Since then, wearables
have made giant leaps in the reduction of size and the increase of functionality. While the
first systems included backpacks containing sizeable electrical equipment, the invention and
rise of mobile phones and smartphones have considerably boosted the development of small,
consumer-grade wearables like smartwatches. Nowadays, wearables can record many differ-
ent kinds of biosignals from the human body by way of a varied array of different kinds of
recording principles and sensors. Signals may, for example, represent brain, muscle, cardiac,
electrodermal,orthermalactivity,aswellasthemotionofdifferentbodyparts(Figure1.3).

in why wearable systems rarely measure them, especially in a long-term context. Electrodes
are challenging to apply correctly by oneself, they can be very obtrusive and stigmatizing,
and typically only last for a few days until they need to be reapplied, producing additional
cost during long-term and ultra-long-term recordings. Furthermore, they are often recorded

and transferred. While some studies presented in this thesis also included devices with elec-
trodesandwirestorecordbiosignals,theresearchpresentedhereexcludesthemfortheabove
reasons.
Consumer-grade wearables and similar devices, however, most often record signals with-
out the use of electrodes and wires. Thereby, sensors frequently target different aspects of
the autonomic nervous system (ANS), with biosignal modalities such as electrodermal activ-
ity(EDA),photoplethysmography(PPG)1,andskintemperature(TMP).Moreover,modalities
such as accelerometry (ACC) and gyroscopy measure the motion of body parts. Section 2.2
goes into further detail regarding these biosignal modalities. A notable difference between
electrographic and wearable biosignal modalities is the variety of the sample rates at which
the devices typically record the signals. While brain activity changes occur in milliseconds,
changes in the autonomic nervous system happen over seconds to minutes. Thus, sample
rates of wearable biosignal recordings, specifically those made with consumer-grade non-
electrographicwearableslikesmartwatches,usuallydonotexceedfrequenciesof100Hz.

The automatic detection of seizures without the need for manual human labor has been
a relevant problem since the beginnings of electrographic epilepsy examinations. Early re-
search focused on analog electrical circuits and systems to detect seizures directly from elec-
troencephalography signals [75], or simple digital computers implementing basic detection
algorithms[76]. Atthesametime,machinelearningmethodologiesdevelopedandadvanced,

1.3.1 Types of Machine Learning
Machine learning is a field of research concerned with designing methodologies and algo-
rithms capable of inferring specific information from unspecific data. The constructs imple-
mentingthisinferencearecalledmodels,andthemethodologiesthatgovernthesemodelsare
generallydescribedbythreedifferentprinciples:
SupervisedLearning: Theinputtothemachinelearningmodelislabeleddata,thatis,each
data sample is given a specific description in relation to the problem at hand. For ex-
ample, in seizure detection the simplest categorization would be a binary labeling of
whether data samples are concurrent with a seizure or not. This data labeling is often
gained from a gold standard knowledge source, for example, marked by epilepsy clini-
cians reviewing the video-electroencephalography data recorded at the epilepsy moni-
toringunit. Thelabeleddataareusedto“train”themachinelearningmodel. Thegeneral
goal is to be able to use this trained model to automatically derive labels for new, unla-
beleddata[77].
UnsupervisedLearning: Data are not labeled by some external mechanism, such that ma-
chine learning methodologies are tasked with automatically finding structures or pat-
terns in the data. A common type of unsupervised modeling are clustering algorithms,
whichfinddatasamplesthataresimilartoeachotherbysomemetric. Optimally,these
clusters or patterns can then be linked to certain aspects of the problem at hand, and
therebyclassifythedata. Semi-supervisedlearningisahybridtypewhereinonlyasmall
subsetofdataislabeledbyhand,increasingtheperformanceoftheclassificationatthe
expense of some human overhead. With respect to seizure detection, an unsupervised
detection model might detect anomalies where some data periods are substantially dif-
ferentfromothers,correspondingtotimeswhenaseizureoccurred[78–80].14 CHAPTER1. INTRODUCTION
ReinforcementLearning: The machine learning algorithm gets direct feedback from the

it was either a true seizure or a false detection, thus improving its performance over

1.3.2 Supervised Machine Learning Models
In supervised learning, algorithms trained with labeled data must generalize to previously
unseen data. This poses a trade-off between bias and variance concerning the ability of a
model to predict the correct output for some arbitrary input data. A model with a high bias,
for example, would not properly represent the structure of the data because it makes certain
incorrect assumptions about the complexity of the data, or lack thereof. It would be under-
fittedandthusmisssomeevents,regardingthemasunimportantbecausetheydonotfitinto
thestructureofthemodel. Conversely,ahighvariancewouldcauseamodeltomaptotraining
datatoowellandregardnoiseasrelevantinformation. Itwouldbeover-fittedanddrastically
change its output even with only minor changes in the training data. One of the goals of
supervised machine learning models is to find a balance between these two aspects. Other
factorsaretheamount,imbalance,dimensionality,andheterogeneityoftrainingdata[77,83].
There are a multitude of different types of supervised machine learning models, and each
type is further divided into different subtypes and implementations. Furthermore, there are
somemeta-methodologiesconcernedwithimprovingpredictiveperformancebycreatingen-
semblesofindividualmodels. Adetaileddescriptionofeachofthesupervisedmachinelearn-
ingmethodologiesisbeyondthescopeofthisintroduction,butthefollowingwillgiveabrief
overview of some major types of algorithms. See relevant introductory literature for more

DecisionTrees: Adecisiontreeisamachinelearningmodelthatconsistsofseveralchained

maximized. The trained mapping is then applied to the unlabeled test data and the1.3. FUNDAMENTALSOFSEIZUREDETECTION 15

NearestNeighbor: This algorithm compares data samples by some distance metric and se-
lects a class according to the training samples nearest to the input sample. Like most
supervised classifiers, it relies on sensible feature engineering and parameter tuning
to achieve good performances. Dimensionality reduction is another preprocessing step

NaiveBayes: Whilethepreviousalgorithms aredeterministicinnature,Bayesiannetworks
are probabilistic learners. Naive Bayes classifiers, a simple form of Bayesian networks,

ArtificialNeuralNetworks: Based in principle on biological neural networks, these mod-
els are a collection of artificial neurons and connections, or more abstractly nodes and
edges. Thisnetworkpropagatesahigh-dimensionalinputtoalow-dimensionaloutput,
through a series of weighted functions. They typically implement back-propagation to
gradually adjust weights over multiple cycles, representing the learning ability of the
network. These models require a large amount of raw input data and are difficult to
interpretindetail[91,92].
Inadditiontotheseindividualtypesofsupervisedmachinelearning,techniquestocompile
and employ multiple instances of these classifiers in a collection have been developed. While
thereareafewdifferentmethodologiesofcreatingtheseensemblesoflearners,thetwomost

Bagging: Bootstrap aggregation, also called bagging, is a method of independently training
multipleindividualclassifierswithrandomlysampleddatafromthetrainingdatasetin
parallel. Duringtesting,newdataarethengiventoallofthesesub-learnersandamajor-
ity vote decides on the output classification of the whole ensemble. This methodology
may mitigate over-fitting that would occur if only a single instance of the individual
learner was used, and thus will typically outperform them. It does however not help
with under-fitting as a high bias in each individual model still results in a high output
bias. The method of aggregating specifically decision tree models in this way is called
randomforest [93,94].
GradientBoosting: Contrarytobagging,gradientboostingtrainsmultiplespecificallyweak

Aside from the classification model itself, supervised seizure detection requires a number of
differentdataanalysissteps,whichcanbeintegratedintoacompleteseizuredetectionpipeline

this pipeline was designed and implemented in the work presented here. Raw data are first

DataPreparation: Raw sensor data typically require some form of preprocessing before it
can be used for further analysis. The amount and type of processing steps involved
dependontheformatandqualityoftherawdataandthepurposeoftheanalysis. They
canrangefromtrivialoperationslikede-duplicationorsorting,overdataqualitychecks
andsynchronizationoftimestamps,tomodifyingprocesseslikesignalfiltering.
FeatureExtraction: Preprocessed sensor data can potentially be used directly, as is for in-
stance done in artificial neural network models. In typical supervised learning applica-
tions,however,itisusuallyfurtherprocessedintoanumberofdifferentfeatures,thatis,
calculated values representing different aspects and properties of the raw data. These
features are most often calculated from sections of data instead of single samples, and
thusdataarefirstsegmentedbeforefeaturesareextracted. Thesedata“windows”have
a certain defined length and interval, both counted in number of samples, which can
potentially result in overlap. The types of features themselves are highly dependent on
the modality of the data and the purpose of the data analysis. Features are typically
grouped as time domain and frequency domain features, according to the nature of the
calculationwithrespecttothetimeseriesdata.
SelectionofTrainingandTestData: Training data for seizure detection models are typi-
cally selected from the peri-ictal data of a number of seizures of a specific type, either
from a single study participant or multiple different ones. In order to properly evalu-
ate a trained detection model, the test data given to the final model for classification
and evaluation need to be completely separate from the data the model was trained
with. Accordingly, the data set is split into training and test data sets before creating
the model, such that the trained model has never seen any of the data in the test set.
In seizure detection, this is optimally done by selecting the test data from a different
patient cohort than the training data, or at least selecting it from other patients in the
same cohort, in the case of generic model evaluation. For individualized models, the
test data would comprise the complete rest of the data for a particular participant, that
was not selected for the training process, whereby the training data would comprise a
specificsetofseizures’peri-ictaldata.1.3.

1.4 Motivation
« Why do we need wearable devices in epilepsy? Seizure diaries derived from
seizures reported by patients and caregivers are unreliable, yet they constitute
the input for therapeutic decisions in clinical practice and for the outcomes in
drug trials. An objective quantification of seizure burden could improve clinical
decision-makingandthequalityofthedrugtrials.»
—SándorBeniczkyetal.,2020[99]
Broadly, the goals and use cases of automatic seizure detection are twofold: Providing
an alarm system or generating a seizure diary. In this thesis, the feasibility of automatically
generating a seizure diary by way of seizure detection with wearable data is investigated.
Nevertheless, patients who suffer from seizures that could be dangerous or life-threatening,
that is, being at risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, need seizure alarms. Especially
during the night or if the patient is alone, an alarm could automatically notify caregivers or
emergencyservicestoprovidehelp. Assuch,theperformancerequirementsforseizurealarm
systems are high, necessitating short latencies from seizure onset to alarm. Some research
on automated seizure alarm systems has used wearable systems, and some products on the
marketalreadyofferthisfunctionality,albeitonlyunderspecificconditionsandforconvulsive
seizures.
Furthermore,whileseveralstudieshaveemployedat-homevideo-electroencephalography
systemssimilartothoseusedinepilepsymonitoringunits[56,100,101],severalfundamental
challengescurrentlylimittheirfeasibilityandthustheiradoptioningeneralclinicalpractice.
Theyarelimitedtoafewdaysofrecordingtime,areimpracticaltosetup,presentconsiderable
overhead concerning integration with in-hospital services, and pose regulatory challenges to
overcome[100].
This thesis investigates seizure detection in automated seizure diaries for ultra-long-term
epilepsy monitoring with wearables. The primary methodology for monitoring epilepsy and
seizures in an ambulatory setting in clinical use is record-keeping in manual seizure diaries
(Section1.1.3). Manualseizurediaries,however,arehighlyunreliable[54,102](Figure1.5). Es-
timatesshowthatpatientstypicallyself-reportlessthan50%ofseizures,especiallyconcern-
ingseizuresoccurringduringsleep[59,102]. Wearabledevicescouldfillthisgapinultra-long-
term epilepsy monitoring, providing relevant biosignals that enable the automated detection
ofepilepticseizures.
To explore the feasibility of automated seizure diaries, biosignal data from wearable de-
vices were collected from patients with epilepsy and several evaluations of methodologies
were done in the context of this thesis. The relevant data collection studies and investiga-
tions were conducted within the scope of the European Union collaborative research project
Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse - Central Nervous System 1. Within this major un-
dertaking, numerous research groups developed new ways of monitoring major depressive
disorder,multiplesclerosis,andepilepsywiththehelpofwearabledevices.

Monitoring epilepsy patients is a necessary clinical tool not only to diagnose and treat
individuals, but also to develop new avenues of treatment (Section 2.1). While some possibil-
ities exist to monitor patients at home with video or video-electroencephalography systems,
they are typically short-term, cumbersome, and intrusive. Wearables on the other hand are
much less burdensome, but still lack in seizure detection performance. Further, patients’ and
caregivers’needsshouldbetakenintoaccountwhendevelopingwearableseizuremonitoring
technologies.
Thecornerstoneofwearablemonitoringarebiosignalsensors,technologythathasexisted

A multitude of different biosignal modalities are available in modern sensor systems, each
with their own opportunities and pitfalls. Here, relevant sensor technology in the context of
epilepsymonitoringisintroducedanddiscussed.

Seizure prediction and forecasting is a related yet different field of research, aiming to
predict seizures before they occur, or at least give estimates of seizure likelihood for some
timeframe (Section 2.4). Even further removed, but in some key ways still comparable, is the
monitoring of other conditions similar to epilepsy. Among these are neurological disorders

In this section the advancements and state-of-the-art in epilepsy monitoring are highlighted.
Wearable devices and their applications have gone through extensive development and re-
search in the past, especially in the last 10-20 years. Not only has their size decreased and
computing power increased substantially, but the sensor technology integrated into the de-
viceshasimprovedaswell[111,112]. Inthesame way,usageofwearabledevicesinepilepsy
research has picked up substantially in the past 10 years. Figure 2.1 shows this development
over the past 20 years on the basis of publication frequency, as indexed on PubMed. Wear-
ablesinhealthcaremonitoringhavethepotentialtoprovidereal-time,continuous,andultra-
long-term biosignal data on a multitude of aspects of the human body [111]. A wide-spread
adoptionofwearabledevicesinpublichealthcaresystems,however,isstillhinderedbyfactors
such as security and privacy [112], integration into electronic health records [113], and engi-
neering challenges like power supply and communication abilities [111, 114]. Yet, wearables
are featured in a large variety of state-of-the-art healthcare research, from classic use cases
like cardiology [115], over sophisticated microfluidic sensing platforms [111], to applications
inpsychophysiology[116].
2.1.1 Monitoring of Patients with Epilepsy
In the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy, short- and long-term monitoring in the in-patient
as well as the out-patient setting are essential [102]. Not only is monitoring necessary to
separateepilepsyfromnon-epilepticsyndromeslikepsychogenicnon-epilepticseizures[117],
butalsotoimprovethemanagementofalreadydiagnosedepilepsy[118]. Anotherimportant

VEEGmonitoringathomehasbeenusedinseveralstudiestovaryingbutgenerallyposi-
tiveresults[56,100]. Whilehospitalconditionsensuregoodqualityrecordingsandthehighest
chancesofcapturingseizureevents,at-homemonitoringisoverallmoreacceptedbypatients
and incurs less cost [56], making it more suitable as a first step in managing an individual’s
epilepsy. Nevertheless, ambulatory vEEG monitoring is limited to the patient’s home, requir-
ingwearabledevicesforcontinuousmonitoring,forexample,whiletravelling[100].
Implantable sub-scalp electroencephalography (EEG) devices are in development, poten-
tiallyprovidingrobustrecordingsofultra-long-termambulatoryEEG[119]. Adoptionofthese
devices may substantially change the landscape of ambulatory epilepsy monitoring. Further-
more, smartphones can serve as an ad hoc solution to provide video monitoring of seizures
outside of dedicated video monitoring units [120]. Data from ambulatory epilepsy monitor-
ing with wearable devices may also contribute to advances in seizure forecasting and pre-
diction [60]. Multiple studies have investigated the feasibility of wearable non-EEG devices
for epilepsy monitoring and seizure detection out of the hospital, but assessment without an
establishedgoldstandardisstillproblematic[110,121–123].
2.1.2 Experiences and Needs of Patients
WhilewearabledevicesaremuchlessintrusiveandburdensomethanvEEGsystems,thereare
still a varietyof aspects to consider whenit comes to their acceptabilityand adoption among
patients with epilepsy [124]. A need to balance costs and benefits arises for patients with re-
specttowearingdevices,withpotentialcostsbeinghigherstigmaandincreasedanxiety,and
perceivedbenefitsbeingimprovedsafetyandfeedbackontheircondition[125]. Additionally,
patients are now in charge of facilitating effective data recordings, and devices and systems
needtoaccountforthelargeheterogeneityintechnologymanagementskillsofpatients[126].
Other important factors to consider are visibility, wear comfort, removability, technical sup-
port, and knowledge or at least perception of the effectiveness of the wearable [72]. In one
studytheperceivedperformanceofthewearabledevice,thatis,thenumberofmissedseizures
or false alarms, was even the main reason for participants to stop using the device, with the
least important factor being the design of the device [127]. However, wearables that utilize
electrodes, cables, patches, and similar parts can substantially change the self-awareness of
patientswithepilepsyandcanleadtohigherperceivedstigma,withthedevicesfurtherhigh-
lightingtheircondition[128]. Themonetarycostofawearabledeviceisalsoapotentialbarrier
andshouldnotbedisregardedwhenconsideringtheimpactonpatients[129].
These experiences and views of patients result in a number of requirements for wearable
devices. Fundamentally, the clinician’s need for a robust seizure detection device translates
topatients’andcaregivers’needsforimprovedsafety,independence,andmanagementofthe
epilepsy [130]. They must be able to trust a given device, that is, be able to depend on it
performing without fail, a need which is amplified when considering pediatric patients and
theirparentalcaregivers[131,132].2.2. BIOSIGNALMODALITIES 27

This section highlights some of the biosignal modalities that can be used for monitoring
epilepsy and seizures, and outlines the working principles of the respective sensors. Specifi-
cally, information on the four main biosignal modalities captured by the Empatica E4 device
iscompiled(seealsoSection3.2.1). Figure2.2givesabriefoverviewofsomeofthesemodali-
ties. Movement is registered by ACC sensors and is a major source of information regarding
epilepticseizureswithmotorcomponents[134]. EDAisanimportantsurrogateforautonomic
nervous system activity [135]. Cardiovascular activity during seizures can be measured by
PPG sensors [136]. Finally, while not specifically used in the analyses presented here, other
relevant biosignals include the skin temperature (TMP) [137] and electrographic modalities
likeelectromyography(EMG).
2.2.1 Movement
ACC sensors in the form of microelectromechanical systems have been some of the most
ubiquitouslyusedsensorsinsmarttechnologyandnowadaysarearegularpartofwearables,
smartphones, and other such devices [138]. The accelerometer captures activity induced by
the sensor’s motion or displacement, typically by variable capacitive measurement (although
piezoresistiveACCsensorsalsoexist),wherebyafreelymovablecomb-likeproofmassswings
between fixed counterparts [139]. This structure effectively combines into capacitors with
varying distances between plates, and thus the capacitance is measurable in an analog elec-28 CHAPTER2. RELATEDWORK
trical circuit. If the sensor begins to move in the direction of its free axis, inertia compels
the proof mass to lag behind the fixed part of the sensor, which is measurable as a change
of capacitance. To achieve three-axis accelerometers, either three such sensors are combined
in one package, one in every direction in three-dimensional space, or in more complex chips
a single proof mass is used with a series of springs providing the necessary degrees of free-
dom[140]. Ananalog-to-digitalconverterthentranslatestheanalogsignalsfromeachsensor
to digital outputs, and a controller interprets them as amplitudes in the unit of g, or m/s2.
Importanttonoteisthat,asthenamesuggests,thesedevicesonlycapturetheaccelerationof
a movement. Thus, an ACC sensor moving at a constant speed will show a constant signal.
This signal includes the earth’s gravitational acceleration of ∼9.81m/s2 or 1g, which a filter
may later isolate from the linear movements in the sensor output, producing an estimate of
orientation[141]. Furthermore,ACCsensorsforhumanactivityrecognitiontypicallyemploy
samplingfrequenciesof25Hzandabove[97],capturingtypicalhumanmotionsandepileptic
movementpatterns,bothofwhichgenerallydon’texceedfrequenciesof10Hz [142,143].
Accelerometers are generally robust against measurement artifacts. Fundamentally, any
movement large enough to cause a change in the analog capacitance could be measured, and
there are no external, physical, or other reasons for the sensor to produce a relevant change
in the signal if there was no movement, provided that it is correctly placed on the body. The
mostimportantconstraintoftheACCsensorsystemistheanalog-to-digitalconversion,which
placesaminimumandmaximumrangeandsensitivityontheoutputsignal[144]. Controller
instructions can sometimes change these parameters to be more or less sensitive towards
smaller movements. For example, a sensorrange of ±2g means thatthe output signalcan be
atmosttwotimestheearth’sgravitationalacceleration. Formovementsofmoreconsiderable
acceleration, as would be expected in clonic movements of generalized tonic-clonic seizures,
theoutputsignalwillbesaturated,thatis,cappedatthevalueof±2g.
Generally, with regard to epileptic seizures, ACC signals can show very heterogeneous
patterns,dependingontheseizuretypeandspecificsemiologiesduringtheseizure. Figure2.3
shows sample ACC recordings of three different seizures with movement components. Con-
vulsive tonic-clonic seizures produce high-amplitude and high-frequency variations in the
ACCsignal,thatcaneasilysaturatethesensorrange. Tonicmovementsoffocalmotorseizures

tremorsvisibleinthelinearcomponent. MyoclonicjerkscansometimesbevisibleintheACC
trace as small signal spikes, but only if no other movements are occurring at the same time,
andtheyareusuallyindistinguishablefromotherrandomshortmovements.
Besides accelerometers, specialized in capturing linear translation, gyroscopy (GYR) sen-
sors can measure rotation more accurately. In many cases, these two sensors are used in
conjunction, applying sensor fusion to better estimate the device’s position and angle [145].
AninertialmeasurementunitcombinesbothACCandGYRsensors,sometimesalsoincluding
amagnetometer[146].
2.2.2 Electrodermal Activity
With increasing body or skin temperature, the sweat gland activity increases, and sweat pro-
duction changes the skin’s electric properties like its conductance, which EDA recordings
can capture [148]. Besides thermoregulatory processes, other sympathetic nervous system
responses like piloerection or psychophysiological arousal may also induce changes in the2.2. BIOSIGNALMODALITIES 29

EDA signals are commonly recorded at sample rates of above 1Hz, while the relevant
frequencyrangeofEDAinformationinthesignalisbelow1Hzforboththephasicandtonic
activities [157]. Low-pass or band-pass filters can filter typical sensor noise on the signal in
the range of >1Hz. Connection loss of the electrodes to the skin due to, for example, body
motion often causes artifacts in the EDA signal [158]. In these cases, the output signal will

typical pulse wave cycle [163]. While green light has a lesser optical penetration depth than
redandinfraredlight[164],shorterlightwavelengthsalsohaveahigherabsorptioncoefficient
in blood [165], resulting in a higher signal-to-noise ratio with respect to monitoring blood
volume in tissue. Thus, green LEDs are generally considered a better alternative to red ones
for PPG sensors, which has been confirmed in comparative studies [166, 167]. Additionally,
PPG sensors can measure changes in blood oxygen saturation by combining green, red, and
infraredlight[160,168,169].
The shape of a clean PPG signal is closely related to the blood pulse wave of the human
body and can vary depending on the specific measurement site [170]. Generally, a heartbeat
is visible through the signal’s rising edge, culminating in the systolic peak, followed by a
declinetowardsthedicroticnotchanddiastolicpeak,andendinginafurtherdeclinetowards
a baseline before the next pulse starts [171]. Figure 2.4 shows the BVP signal in detail. The
heart rate (HR) is thereby directly and accurately derivable from the peak to peak intervals
between single systolic peaks. Depending on the circumstances and properties of the sensor,
a lower-frequency component attributed to the breathing frequency of the subject may also
modulate the raw signal [172]. Some sensors and devices, however, may immediately filter
out this signal component and not include it in the output data. The PPG signal may also
sometimes be referred to as BVP in literature, and in this thesis the term BVP is used for the
filteredoutputsignalofawearabledevice,whereasPPGistherawsensordata.
Because the raw output signal of a PPG sensor is a function of the amount of light falling
intothephotoelectricsensor,externallightcontaminatingthereflectedlightfromthesensor’s
LED can heavily skew this signal [136, 160, 173]. This signal corruption is especially critical2.2. BIOSIGNALMODALITIES 31

in wearable devices since the sensor might only be loosely attached to the body to keep it
comfortabletowear. Anymovementofthedeviceorthebodypartitisattachedtomayresult
in the sensor lifting from the skin, which will invariably result in some motion artifact in
the signal [174]. While some research presents methods to clean PPG signals from motion
artifacts [175–177], including some using a simultaneously recorded ACC signal [178–180],
they are only effective in removing minor short artifacts or those resulting from repetitive
motionslikerunning[181].
2.2.4 Temperature
Some wearables can record thermal activity by measuring the skin temperature (TMP) of the
user’s body. Note that this does not capture the core temperature, so measured values are
often lower than those commonly known for human core body temperature, for example,
when determining fever, and are more prone to environmental influences [182]. Thus, TMP
reflects a combination of the ambient and skin temperature at the recording location [183].
TMP signals are prone to sudden modulation as the environment changes, for example, due

thewearableisattached. Furthermore,thebaselineofthesignalmaychangesubstantiallyina
seasonalcontext,asaveragetemperatureswouldbehigherduringthesummerthanduringthe
winter. Like other responses of the sympathetic nervous system, changes in peripheral body
temperature can take multiple seconds or minutes and might occur delayed [184]. Therefore,
artifacts in the temperature signal can register as sudden spikes or dips, for example, as the
subject removes the wearable from the body for a short time. These could be detected by
monitoring andthresholding the rate ofamplitude change, similarto the artifacts seenin the
EDAsignal[159].
Temperatureiscommonlymeasuredwithwearablesbyoneoftwoprinciples: Directmea-
surementwiththesensorunitinimmediatecontactwiththeskinorindirectbyinfraredradia-
tion measurements. The former methodology is most commonly achieved using a thermistor
component, a resistor highly dependent on temperature [137]. The latter methodology can
be implemented by thermopiles, components that connect different kinds of metal in series
and thus exploit the thermoelectric effect, or pyroelectric sensors, measuring changes in the
chargeoverthesurfaceofpyroelectriccrystals[185]. Concerningepilepsy,someresearchhas
investigated the role of thermoregulation [186, 187], however its causes, effects, and interac-
tions are still poorly understood. Overall, there is no conclusive evidence as to the relevance
of TMP measurements for epilepsy monitoring and the analyses presented in this thesis do
notincludethissignal.
2.2.5 Other Sensors and Biosignals
Electrodes attached to stationary systems in a hospital or dedicated monitoring unit usually
captureelectrographicsignalslikeelectroencephalography(EEG),electrocardiography(ECG),
and EMG. Wearables recording these biosignal modalities do exist, although they frequently
includecumbersomewiresandadhesiveelectrodepatches,makingthemlesscomfortableand
more noticeable to wear, the opposite of how users prefer wearable devices to be [124, 188].
Furthermore,otherbiosignalrecordingsystemsthatarenotwearablebutrelevanttothetopic

EEG signals measure electric activity on the scalp as a surrogate marker of brain activ-
ity [189]. Wet electrodes attached to the skin by conductive gel or dry electrodes using adhe-

most notably used in epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) in combination with video monitor-
ing,asoutlinedinSection1.1.3. WearableEEGdevicesforambulatoryrecordingshaveexisted
for some time, traditionally as full-fledged electrode arrays in the form of a dry electrode cap
worn over the whole head [190]. More recently, low- or single-channel EEG wearables are

Like ECG measurements, EMG records the electrical activity generated by muscle tissue
when activated but is specific to skeletal muscles [198]. Wearable EMG systems are often

under a mattress can indicate epileptic activity in seizures with convulsive motor manifesta-
tions [208–210], but these sensors have some noteworthy disadvantages [102, 211], making
them niche devices unattractive for regular clinical use. Section 2.5 compiles further related

In this section, the state-of-the-art literature concerning seizure detection with wearables is
presented. In recent years a variety of review articles have been published from different
groups,assessingwearabledevicesandtheirperformancesinseizuredetectionmethodologies.
A clinical practice guideline and standards for testing have been developed, introducing best
practicesforevaluatingandvalidatingseizuredetectiondevicesandmethodologies[109,212].
Anexhaustivereviewofcommerciallyavailableseizuredetectiondeviceshasbeenpublished,
compiling their capabilities and evidence of performance, if available [122]. Furthermore, re-
cent reviews of studies predominantly evaluating convulsive TCSs have shown that mobile
health devices are a promising method for epilepsy monitoring especially in out-of-hospital
contexts (Figure 2.5) [108, 109, 121, 213]. However, while there are a number of studies eval-
uating the performance of focal seizure (FS) detection, there still is a lack of evidence for a
robustdetectionevenincontrolledconditions,muchlessinanambulatorysetting[110].
2.3.1 Major Convulsive Seizures
PrimarilyconvulsiveTCSs,thatis,generalizedtonic-clonicseizuresorfocaltobilateraltonic-
clonic seizures (FBTCSs), are the most dangerous and severe seizure type due to their vio-
lentpathologyandhighriskfactorintheoccurrenceofsuddenunexpecteddeathinepilepsy
(SUDEP) [18, 19]. Thus, a robust detection of these seizures is of utmost importance not
only in the development of alarm systems, but also the improvement of seizure diaries for2.3. SEIZUREDETECTIONWITHWEARABLES 35
the advancement of therapies. Furthermore, their symptoms inherently make TCSs the most
straightforward seizure type todetect with wearables. Accordingly, there already are numer-
ous published studies investigating these seizures with a variety of devices and methodolo-
gies, some few even rated as phase 4 studies designed prospectively and with a predefined
andfixedmethodology[109,212]. Thecurrentbeststate-of-the-artperformancesreportedin
some studies include sensitivities of >90% and false alarm rates (FARs) of as low as 0.2 per
24h.
Monomodal detection of TCSs has been considered with almost every kind of relevant
biosignal modality that can be measured from wearables. ACC is the most obvious modality
to use for these convulsive motor seizures [134]. Johansson et al. [214], for example, use a
wrist-worninertialsensortodetectTCSsinadultpatientsvisitingavideo-electroencephalog-
raphymonitoringunit. Theyevaluatethreedifferentsupervisedlearningalgorithms,withthe

post-ictal phase, and cardiac abnormalities are a major risk factor concerning SUDEP [217].
Thus, the detection of TCSs with HR and heart rate variability (HRV) data from wearables
hasbeeninvestigatedbyseveralstudies. MohammadpourTouserkanietal.[218]recordpho-
toplethysmography (PPG) signals from a wrist- or ankle-worn wearable sensor and extract
several features from it. They do not specifically investigate a detection algorithm, but de-
scribe in detail the pre- and post-seizure periods of TCSs compared to a baseline in terms of
these extracted features. The authors do this to avoid the severe motion artifacts PPG signals
would have during the ictal phase of TCSs, which further highlights the lack of evidence of
studiesusingPPGinmonomodalTCSdetection. Therearesomestudiesusingelectrocardiog-
raphy(ECG)signalsinsteadtodetectconvulsiveseizures,buttheseareusuallyrecordedfrom
hospitalmonitoringsystems[219,220].
Beniczkyetal.[203]andZibrandtsenetal.[221]bothusewearableEMGdevicestodetect
TCSs in epilepsy patients, the former with a surface patch EMG device and the latter with an
in-ear device. Both report sensitivities of above 90% and less than one false positive per day,
butneithercommentsonthecomfortandacceptanceofthedevicefromthepatients’pointof
view. Furthermore,therehavealsobeennumerousstudiesinthepastfewyearsinvestigating
the value of wearable electroencephalography (EEG) recordings [121]. Lastly, some efforts
have also been made to detect convulsive seizures during the night with the help of at-home
videosystems,usingvideomotionanalysistoisolateperiodsofhighactivity[204,222].
Multimodal detection of TCSs, that is, using two or more different biosignal modalities,
with data from wearable devices, is the next logical advancements from the monomodal de-
tectionthatthepreviouslymentionedstudiesuse. Onoratietal.[223,224]useACCandEDA
data from a wrist-worn wearable device to detect primarily convulsive TCSs, although they

of the wearable device they used, the Empatica E4 also used in the studies included here (see
Section3.1.3andSection3.2.1).
Multimodal detection has also been investigated in other groups. Tang et al. [225] work
withawrist-wornwearabledevice(thesameasOnoratietal.[223,224])torecordACC,EDA,
and blood volume pulse (BVP) data, using different combinations of features from these sig-
nals to train convolutional neural network models. Their data set includes TCSs as well as
different types of FSs recorded from a predominantly pediatric cohort. For TCSs, they report
a sensitivity of 80% and a FAR of more than 13 per day when using the combination of ACC
and EDA features. Interestingly, the combination using features from all three modalities did
notperformbestforanyoftheseizuretypesincludedinthisstudy. Arendsetal.[226]present

Cogan et al. [227] recorded HR, blood oxygen saturation, and EDA data with a wearable de-
vice for the evaluation of a multi-stage seizure detection methodology. They included three
convulsive seizures and 23 complex partial seizures (CPSs) in their data set, although they do

Figure2.5showstheperformancesofsomestudiesinvestigatingTCSdetectionusingboth
monomodal and multimodal methods [108]. A direct quantitative comparison of the results
in this way is subject to uncertainties like differences in modalities, timespans of as much as
10yearsbetweenstudies,orfundamentaldifferencesinmethodologies,andthusunadvisable.
Nevertheless, it gives an idea of rough average performances of related work, which helps
to contextualize the results of this thesis, especially those of the TCS detection presented in
Section4.1.
2.3.2 Focal Motor Seizures
FSs are the most commonly occurring type of epileptic seizure in the general population [15,
228, 229]. However, due to their relatively lower footprint and higher heterogeneity in terms
ofpossiblesymptoms,theyaresubstantiallyhardertodetectfromtypicaldatarecordedwith
wearabledevices. Here,FSsdonotincludeFBTCSs,eventhoughtheytechnicallyhaveafocal
onset. In a later part of the thesis, Table 5.7 also compiles a list of related work that includes
FSintheevaluationofvariousseizuredetectionmethodologies.
Vandecasteeleetal.[74]useaSVMmodeltodetectFSswithimpairedawarenessfromHRV
features, extracted from both ECG and PPG signals. They compare the performances of the
models and conclude that the data from a wrist-worn PPG sensor are insufficient for seizure
detection(sensitivity32%),whereasthewearableECGdatashowpromise(sensitivity70%).
They specifically acknowledge motion artifacts as the main reason for the poor performance
ofthemodelbasedonPPGdata.
Munch Nielsen et al. [230] propose a multimodal FS detection and record ECG, ACC, and
behind-the-earEEGfromwearabledevices. Intheiranalysistheauthorsincludedonepatient
with predominantly motor FSs with stereotypical tonic movement symptoms. Employing a
SVM classifier, the authors report a sensitivity of up to 91% and as low as 8 false alarms per
day,dependingonthedecisionthreshold.2.3. SEIZUREDETECTIONWITHWEARABLES 37
Baumgartner et al. [231] extract features from surface EMG signals and use them in an
amplitude analysis threshold detection methodology, detecting TCSs as well as a variety of
different motor FSs. Among the FS types, they could correctly detect 50% of seizures with
tonic and/or clonic features, and 76% of seizures with other symptoms like automatisms or
hyperkineticmovements. TheydonotfurtherspecifyaFAR,butshowthatautomateddetec-
tionperformanceissimilartoexpertraterclassificationfromthesamedata.
Tang et al. [225] also include FSs in their data set (see Section 2.3.1), but do not further
specify performances of their methodology for these seizure types in a comparable manner.
However,theyreportthatACCisthebestmodalityforfocaltonicseizures,EDAtogetherwith
BVP for automatisms, and BVP for behavior arrests. They also conclude that individualized
modelsmayimprovedetectionperformance.
Vandecasteele et al. [191] use recordings from behind-the-ear EEG electrodes in a semi-
automated FS detection. First, they had an expert rater visually annotate seizures in the data,
and then used these labels to train a SVM detection model. In a patient-specific evaluation
theycouldreportasensitivityof69%and0.5falsealarmsperday. Theauthorsconcludethat
while these results seem low, they are still better than patient self-reports for these types of
seizures.
Due to their typically short duration of just a few seconds and low movement profile of
slight jerks of a body part, myoclonic FSs are some of the hardest epileptic seizure types to
detect from wearable device data. Thus, research investigating this problem is sporadic at
best. Hyppönenetal.[232],forexample,developavideo-baseddetectionsystemfortheeval-
uation of myoclonic FSs. Specifically, they aim to automatically quantify myoclonic jerks by
amplitude and frequency, estimated from optical flow of the video. They report a high level

limitednumberofsubjectsandvideowasrecordedonlyduringexplicitandsupervisedtasks.
2.3.3 Focal Non-Motor and Other Seizures
To date there is only sporadic research specifically investigating the detection of non-motor
FSs with wearables. Some studies include these seizure types as a subset, sometimes more
as an aside to convulsive seizures than their own seizure type. Not only is the detection of
non-motor seizures an inherently more difficult task, but there is also less immediate need
in general for a robust detection system for these seizures, as opposed to convulsive seizures
thataremuchmoreintrusiveanddangeroustothepatient. Studiesconsideringthedetection
of non-motor FSs, naturally, are often limited to non-movement-related biosignal modalities.

Tachycardia, that is, a substantial rise in HR over a short amount of time or a consis-
tently high HR over longer periods, is a major symptom of epileptic seizures in general, and
also non-motor seizures specifically [12, 29, 37]. Thus, many studies about the detection of
non-motorseizureswithwearablesfocusonmodalitieslikeECGorPPG,andHRorHRVsig-
nals, to detect events [41]. However, the restriction to only HR and HRV features has shown
to be problematic when applied to general population cohorts. Ictal autonomic changes are
limited to “responders”, that is, only some individual patients exhibit these symptoms during
seizures [219, 233]. Furthermore, the current evidence of FS detection with monomodal sig-38 CHAPTER2. RELATEDWORK
nals shows performances of below 80% sensitivity with often multiple false detections per
hour[234,235].
Munch Nielsen et al. [230] propose a multimodal FS detection and record ECG, ACC, and

included in their analysis [74, 227, 237, 238]. Studies will usually categorize seizures by one
of the clinical classifications (e.g., Fisher et al. [27]), but if there is no specific focus on motor
seizures in their evaluation and modalities like ACC are not used, information about move-
mentsduringseizuresisoftenomitted. Whiletheinclusionofthisinformationmaynotseem
immediately relevant for this type of evaluation, it is important to include it regardless. Ar-
tifacts from movement are a major disruptive factor for all physiological modalities recorded

indicateapreferenceformonomodaldetectionwithACCsignalswhich,onaverage,trendsto-
wards lower FARs than multimodal detection. However, this does not account for differences
in wearable sensors, study protocols, or recent developments in the state-of-the-art. Current
studies using multimodal detection with both the ACC and EDA modalities, including the
analysis included in this thesis (Section 4.1.3), have reported better results than the average
monomodaldetectionusingjustACC.
Related work concerning the detection of FSs, with or without movement components,
is even more heterogeneous. At the same time, there are also less published studies investi-
gating the wearable non-EEG detection of exclusively FSs, as compared to studies including
TCSs. Furthermore, current work generally does not highlight the need for, and utility of, in-
dividualizeddetectionmodels. Thus,theanalysesincludedinthisthesis,specificallythework

the work presented here focuses on seizures with epileptic movements, it could also be used
similarly for non-motor FSs, possibly with a different combination of biosignals that omits

2.4 Seizure Prediction and Forecasting
Seizure prediction, as opposed to detection, specifically refers to the intention of predicting
seizures before they happen, with the goal of potential intervention. Seizure forecasting is
sometimesregardedasasubfieldofstudythatusuallydoesn’taimtopredictaspecificfuture
seizure but estimates the likelihood of seizures happening at some point in the future [239,
240]. Both prediction and forecasting have been shown to be possible for some patients with
epilepsy in controlled retrospective studies, but application in the real world is still lack-
ing [240, 241]. While seizure prediction research predominantly started by using in-hospital
electroencephalography(EEG)data,otherbiomarkershavesincebeenintroduced,inparticu-
laralsowiththeapplicationofwearabledevices,lookingtowardsultra-long-termambulatory
forecasting[53,60,239].
Generallyspeaking,seizurepredictionmethodologiesfoundinliteraturecanbeseparated
intotwobroadcategories: thosethatexplicitlyleveragecyclicstructuresinthere-occurrence
of seizures, and those that do not. At first glance, epilepsy seems to appear as random oc-
currences of seizures. However, rhythmic manifestation in circadian1, multidien2, or even
circannual3 cycles can be found in a considerable portion of patients [242, 243]. Concerning
circadian rhythms, differences between daytime and nighttime periods are the driving fac-
tor, affecting the autonomic nervous system [244], and thus possibly the occurrence of some
seizure types [42, 245]. These rhythms can be captured by wearable devices recording data
like heart rate (HR) or electrodermal activity [246, 247]. Multidien HR cycles could also be
linkedtoseizureoccurrence,withthedatabeingrecordedbyawearabledevicewithaphoto-
plethysmographysensor[248].
Datafromwearabledeviceshavealsobeenusedinsomestudiesinvestigatingseizurefore-
casting without expressly looking for rhythmic patterns. Notably, deep learning approaches
have emerged as successful in direct seizure prediction [249, 250]. In a seminal study, ultra-

not strictly seizure prediction, this result may still provide value towards early warning and
intervention systems, specifically in those seizures where clinical symptom onset is delayed
afterEEGonset. Someresearchhasalsoinvestigatedthefeasibilityofseizurepredictorsfrom
metadatasuchasmanualseizurediarieskeptbythepatients[252].
There has notably also been some progress made towards crowdsourcing the problem of
seizureprediction[253,254]. Potentialsolutionsaredependentonevaluationwithultra-long-
term data recordings that include multiple seizures over periods of sometimes months, and
thiskindofdataaregenerallynotreadilyavailabletoallresearchers. Disseminatingdatasets
in a crowdsourcing manner may help substantially in improving prediction and forecasting

2.5 Non-epileptic Seizures and Similar Conditions
In the wider field of general healthcare there are a variety of conditions and adverse events
that can manifest with symptoms comparable to those of epileptic seizures. The most imme-
diate relative are psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNESs), which are also often explicitly
considered in epilepsy research. Further, there are a number of diseases that are symptomat-
ically related to epilepsy, like multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), both of
which include motor spasms or tremors in their list of possible symptoms. In addition, there
aresomemoredistantlyrelatedproblemsingeneralhealthcare-relatedactivitytracking.
A PNES is a seizure event initiated by psychological mechanisms, as opposed to specific
epilepticactivityinthebrain. Oneofthemainoutcomesofin-hospitalmonitoringunitsisthe
differentialdiagnosisbetweenepilepticseizuresandPNES,andthereareavarietyofdifferent
diagnostictoolstoaidinthiseffort[255]. Someresearchhasinvestigateddistinctionbetween
the two from physiological non-video-electroencephalography data. For example, muscle ac-
tivation patterns, captured by surface electromyography signals, have been found to indicate
the type of seizure event [201, 256]. Similarly, movement patterns captured by accelerome-
try (ACC) were used to distinguish between convulsive epileptic seizures, PNES, and normal
movements[142,257].
MS is a disease of the central nervous system characterized by a wide range of symp-
toms, including motor dysfunctions which can manifest as walking impairments. Therefore,
gait analysis has been a target of research, employing ACC sensors as a source of movement
data [258, 259]. In this context, wearable devices have similar advantages as in epilepsy re-
search: theyprovidecontinuousdatainalong-termambulatorysettingwhilebeingunobtru-
siveandeasytouse[260–262].
PD is a neurodegenerative condition that manifests in different symptoms, with involun-
tary tremors being a fundamental indication that includes a motor component. PD is also
a highly progressive disease, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring and manage-
ment[263]. Therefore,ACC-basedmonitoringhasbeeninvestigatedtobothclassifyandquan-
tifytremorsusing,forexample,smartphones[264]orwrist-wornwearables[265,266].
Automatically detecting falls would give meaningful opportunity for timely intervention
and assistance, and research on this topic has seen an upsurge in recent years [267]. Not
only is it highly relevant for the care of elderly people, but there is a meaningful connection
to epilepsy as well, with some seizure types like atonic motor seizures often resulting in the

2.6 Summary
Thischaptercompiledthestate-of-the-artliteratureinepilepsymonitoringandseizuredetec-
tionwithwearabledevices. Theusageofwearablesinepilepsyresearchhasonlybeguninthe
last 10-15 years, but since then the number of publications on this topic grew exponentially.
Robust monitoring of epilepsy not only in the hospital but also at home is necessary to en-
able effective diagnosis, intervention, management, and research. While the gold standard of
video-electroencephalographyisusedinmonitoringunits,itisnotfeasibleforambulatoryas-
sessment, and wearables could fill this gap. However, patients also want effective, affordable,
andinconspicuousdevices.
Wearablescanrecordavarietyofdifferentbiosignals,someofwhicharerelevanttoepilep-
sy. Accelerometrycapturesmovementsofthebody,datawhichcanbeusedtotraindetection
models for epileptic seizures with movement manifestations. Electrodermal activity sensors
record electrical properties of the skin that can change during seizures, but are dependent on
dryelectrodesandskincontact. Photoplethysmographysignalscanbeusedtoestimateheart
rate (HR) and other cardiac features, but the sensors are very susceptible to motion artifacts.
Other biosignal modalities exist and are recorded by a number of different sensors, but these
arenotrelevanttothecontentofthisthesis.
Seizure detection can be monomodal or multimodal, that is, using one or more biosig-
nal modality, but a general preference is not obvious from current literature and depends on
context. The detection of tonic-clonic seizures has the highest-performing evidence in re-
lated work, and phase 4 prospective ambulatory studies are beginning to yield results. Motor
focal seizures (FSs) can be difficult to detect, but some evidence shows that there is good po-
tential for robust wearable seizure detection systems, especially if model personalization is
implemented. Non-motor FSs are possibly the hardest to detect with wearables, relying on
physiological modalities like HR, and there is little evidence in literature so far that attempts
detectionwithnon-electroencephalography(EEG)data.
Both the prediction of seizures and the detection of non-epileptic seizure-like events are
notdirectlyinvolvedintheresearchincludedinthisthesis. However,theyarecloselyrelated
in that general concepts of machine learning can be applied similarly to these topics. Seizure
prediction aims to predict seizures before they happen, or in the case of forecasting, to esti-
mateaprobabilityofseizuresoccurringinaspecifictimeframe. Generally,thisisdoneeither
by leveraging predictable cyclic structures in the occurrences of seizures for some patients,
or by deep learning modeling with wearable data. As these tasks require a lot of data over
months or years, data sharing and crowdsourcing has a high priority. Non-epileptic seizures
areseizure-likeeventsthatdonotshowtypicalepilepticEEGpatterns,andtheclosestrelative
in this regard are psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. To correctly diagnose these, epilepsy
monitoring units perform differential diagnosis. Other diseases with partially similar symp-
toms to epilepsy and where wearables are used in research are multiple sclerosis or Parkin-
son’sdisease. Theanalysismethodologiespresentedinthisthesiscouldbemodifiedtoenable
the detection of events like these, likely involving the use of different types of biosignals or
features thereof. From a broader perspective, the use of wearables in epilepsy is only one
medical application, with others including fields like fall detection, sleep quality assessment,
orcardiologicalapplications.

performances, facilitating a placement of the results included in the following two chapters
within the state-of-the-art. Concluding from current developments in the field, the detec-
tion of epileptic seizures with low-profile, low-cost, non-EEG wearables is a very promising
approach, and the research presented in this thesis takes a meaningful step towards robust
detectionsystems.3

3.1.1 Clinical Study Design
IdentificationofStudyAims
The definition of study aims and related methods determine the patient selection, device
choice, data annotations, curation, and data analysis. Seizure detection may serve many dif-
ferent purposes, from closed-loop treatment of acute seizures and impending status epilepti-
cus[279,280],toretrospectiveassessmentofclinicalseizureburdenandassessmentoftherisk
of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), as well as evaluation of clinical devices or

to be mobile and to be robust to patient movement, whereas devices for detection of noctur-

or a camera may be pointed at the patient from a fixed location [204]. Device acceptability

Theprocessofobtaininginformedconsentisregulatedbyprinciplesembodiedinthecur-

participate in a research study and is essential for valid informed consent as defined by the

The studies presented in this thesis followed these principles and considerations, acquir-

StudyPopulation
Selecting the study population to appropriately address the research question is crucial in
study design. In particular, it is important to match the subject characteristics, epilepsy type,
orseizuresemiologyinthestudycohorttothegoalsofthestudy. Intheseprospectivecohort
studiespatientswithadiagnosisofepilepsywererecruitedwhentheypresentedforepilepsy
care at the hospital epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU), and were asked to wear one or more
wearable devices. While in the EMU, patients were monitored for seizures via vEEG, which
wasrecordedalongwiththesensordatafromthewearables.
Asphysiologicalresponsesandsignalalterationsduringepilepticseizuresmayvaryacross
age groups, the inclusion of participants of different ages needs to be taken into account. In
the studies included here, the lower and upper limit of age for study participants ranged be-
tween 7 years and 80 years, respectively. Moreover, at the stage of protocol development, it
is important to identify those comorbidities that may interfere with study adherence or with
data collection and quality. Patients with conditions impeding the ability to participate (cog-
nitive,psychiatric,acutelyill),towearthedevice(skinconditions),orwithfrequentvigorous
involuntarymovements(e.g.,chorea,athetosis)wereexcludedfromthestudies.
Baseline characteristics of the included participants allow the population under study to
bebettercharacterized,theresultsobtainedtobeunderstoodandcontextualized,andforgen-
eralizability of the data to be discussed. For all the study participants, data collected during
the study period included basic demographic characteristics including age and gender, clin-
ical information, and seizure characteristics including etiology, localization, type, onset, and
frequencyofseizuresandmedications.
During the studies presented in this thesis, patients with epilepsy were recruited at the
EMUsoftheKing’sCollegeHospitalLondon(KCL)andtheUniversityMedicalCenterFreiburg
(UKF).Table3.1givesanoverviewofsomeoftherelevantinformationandkeydemographics

for collaboration. The labeled vEEG recordings were then transferred to a secure server for
storage and analysis, and seizure onset and offset times were applied to the simultaneously
collectedwearablerecordings.
Wearabledatacollectionanddeviceintegration
Data collection with wearables is generally done in one of two approaches: offline collection,
wherethedataarestoredlocallyonthedeviceandthendownloadedatalatertime,oronline
collection, where the data are streamed continually via a wireless connection to an external
device.
Duringonlinecollection,thewearabledeviceusuallyhasamuchshorterbatterylife,since
wirelessdatatransmissionaddssubstantiallytotheoverallenergyconsumption. However,the
maximumrecordingtimeinofflinecollectionisconstrainedbytheinternalstoragecapacityof
the device. Furthermore, the data must be manually downloaded from the device, potentially
requiringregularpatientparticipation.
This process can be automated during online collection, at the expense of a potential for
data loss due to connection problems. An added benefit to data streaming is the possibility
oflivedataprocessingandvisualization,allowingcaretakersandstudypersonneltoevaluate
data as they come in. Live data streaming is also a key requirement for any intervention or
alarmsystemnotdirectlybuiltintothewearabledevice.

SynchronizationbetweenwearableandvEEGdata
Time synchronization between an external device and the vEEG is particularly important in
thefieldofepilepsyresearch. Theclinicalseizureonset,usedasthegroundtruthindeveloping
modelsforseizuredetectionandprediction,canoftenbepinpointedwithsub-secondprecision
by clinical experts. Thus synchronizing the internal time of the wearable device to the time
of the vEEG system is essential for data analysis. Furthermore, depending on the specific
deviceused,internalinaccuraciescancausesmallshiftsinthetimekeepingbetweenindividual
biosignaldatastreams.

vEEG systems suffer from an occasional minor desynchronization of the EEG and video. The
data streams can then be synchronized retrospectively by adjusting the wearable data times-
tamps to align the events with the vEEG. Although the data streams can be synchronized to
sub-secondprecisionwiththismethod,itrequiresmanualmodificationofthedata.
Both methods are susceptible to the internal drift of timekeeping in the wearable, caused
byinaccuraciesinthereal-time-clockcircuitsinthesedevices. Thisdriftcanaccumulateover
time, up to several seconds of inaccuracy over several hours of recording. Therefore, it is
advisable to repeat the synchronization process periodically during the recording. The auto-
matedmethodismoresuitableforthis,asthesynchronizationcouldbetriggered,forexample,
every few minutes. Another method to deal with drifting timestamps directly is to measure
individual calibration parameters for each device that is used in a study. Thereby, the precise
sampling rate for a device is found by a calibration procedure, to a degree of accuracy that
allows for a later recalibration of the timestamps in the recorded signals. Synchronizing the
wearable data with the vEEG system can also enable integration of both into a common data
viewer,whichfacilitatesabetterunderstandingofabstractwearabledatainthecontextofthe

quently, each center synchronized their wearable devices each time they were exchanged for
batterycharging,withintervalsrangingfromtwiceperdaytoevery2days. Section3.2gives
a more detailed description of the wearable device and technical infrastructure implemented
forthestudies.
3.1.3 Devices
Acrossthetwostudysites,KCLandUKF,severaldifferentwearabledeviceswereusedfordata
collection from study participants. Among the most prominent devices were Biovotion’s Eve-
rion,IMEC’ssensorbracelet,Epitel’sEpilog,Byteflies’Dots,andEmpatica’sE4. Thedataquality
andpatientacceptanceofsomeofthesedeviceshavebeenreportedpreviously[159,173,292].
In the studies included in this thesis, only data from the Empatica E4 device (Section 3.2.1;
Empatica Inc., Boston, MA, USA) were used for further analysis, as it was used in the overall
largestamountofparticipants.
Wearabledevicesofthetypesusedinclinicalepilepsystudiescanbecategorizedinvarious
ways,allofwhichshouldfactorintothedecisionwhenselectingadeviceforastudy:
Medicalcertification: Wearables, in general, are employed in many different fields beyond
medicine, so for use in studies as described here, the certification as a medical device
can be an important factor. IMEC’s sensor bracelet for example, as a prototype device,
is not independently certified, whereas the Empatica E4 has a European CE class IIa
certificationasamedicaldevice.3.1. STUDYPROCEDURES 51
Modalities: Different devices record different biosignals at different sample rates, so an in-
formed decision needs to be made about exactly what is needed to facilitate the out-
comes of the given study. Multimodal devices are generally regarded as more effective
andversatile[293–295],whereasadevicerecordingonlyonemodalitymaybesufficient
foraveryspecifictask. Epitel’sEpilog,forexample,providesonlyasingle-channelEEG
signal,whereastheEmpaticaE4recordsfourdifferenttypesofrawbiosignaldata.
Datamode: Generally,therearetwomodesindatacollection,onlineoroffline,asdescribed
furtherinSection3.1.2. Inmostcasesagivendevicesupportsonlyonemodeforrecord-
ing data, so either the study protocol needs to be adjusted to support the device, or an
appropriatedeviceneedstobechosenforanalreadyestablishedstudyprotocol. Theon-
linestreamingmodeisarequirementforsystemsthatshouldincludeanykindofalarm
or intervention. Byteflies’ Dots, for example, support only offline recordings, whereas
theEmpaticaE4hastheoptiontoemploybothmethods.
Batterylife: With current battery technology, the battery life of smaller devices or those
that employ online raw data streaming is usually measured in hours, whereas some-
what larger devices with offline, on-device data storage can sometimes be active for
days without the need to recharge. IMEC’s sensor bracelet, for example, has a typical
battery life of seven days, while the Empatica E4 has a manufacturer-specified battery
life of 24h to 48h, although in these studies empty batteries after half that time were
oftenobserved. ThiswasinpartduetotheshorterbatterylifespanwhentheE4isused
instreamingmode.
Deviceplacement: Wearables are usually placed at a specific part of the body, which can
be influenced by the study protocol and should be considered when choosing a device.
In turn, the placement of the device may affect both the sensitivity and specificity of a
prospective seizure detector. The Empatica E4, for example, is normally worn around
thewrist,whiletheByteflies’Dotscanbeattachedtoanypartofthebodybyuseofan
adhesivepatch.
Furthermore, research-grade devices, such as the Empatica E4, often have several advan-
tagesanddisadvantagesoverotherdevicesthataremarketeddirectlytoconsumerend-users.
Access to raw data is a necessity for many research studies, but something that consumer-
grade devices and services rarely provide. Furthermore, companies offering research-grade
devices are sometimes open to collaboration, for example, by supporting researchers with
specializedknowledgeofdevicecapabilities.
On the other hand, research devices are often more expensive than their consumer coun-
terpartsandcanbemorecumbersomeanduncomfortabletowear,sincethedevice’saesthetic
design is not a priority for the manufacturer. However, patients consistently gave more pos-
itive feedback on the wearability of the Empatica E4, as compared to the Biovotion Everion,
whichisadeviceonthemarketforregularconsumerstobuy[292].

digital solutions into health care services [125, 296]. The research focused on hypothetical
scenarioshashighlightedthatmotivationtousewearablesisnotdrivenonlybytheaccuracy
and reliability of the device performance. A design incorporating comfort and ease of use is
alsoessentialforacceptanceandlong-termadoption[292]. Obtainingfeedbackfrompatients
after direct experience wearing devices is the only way to fully understand the practical and
technicalissuesfaced[297]. However,feedbackondevicecomfortandusabilityhasbeencol-
lected only sporadically in previous studies, and information reflecting the direct experience
of study participants is missing. The limited number of investigations exploring users’ direct
experience reported improvement of quality of life for both patients and caregivers [297], a
benefit to autonomy and increasing independence in activities [226, 297], as well as a gener-
ally good evaluation of technology usability [226, 298]. Barriers to use, as reported, include
discomfortinwearingthedeviceduringsleep,technicaldifficulties,andtheburdenofadding
anotheraspecttoroutineepilepsycare[297].
In addition to the key requirements of a reliable and accurate performance, a successful
integration of digital solutions into a patient pathway requires acceptance of the technology.
Thelatterisrequiredforlong-termengagement,whichisessentialtoagooddetectionperfor-
mance,andtooptimizethebenefittothepatient. Toidentifyandavoidpotentialbarrierstoa
long-termengagementwiththetechnology,patients’viewsandrequirementsneedtoinform
the development of the technology and study design, and users’ opinions on usability and

ticipants range from a focus group (useful during the first stages to guide research questions
andresearchdevelopment),interviews(atsettimepointsduringthestudy,forexample,study
end or in case of participants’ withdrawal), collection of participants’ observations (any time

Dataqualityandcompleteness
Thevalueofcollecteddatacanbeassessedbydatacompletenessanddataquality. Dataqual-
ity measures evaluate properties like the noisiness, accuracy, and potential information gain
of the data, whereas data completeness gauges data loss during recording. In the context of
exploratory research, both data quality and completeness are of utmost importance, and sev-
eral steps were taken to reflect that need. Collecting raw, unprocessed data from wearable
devices, forgoing any internal processing, can facilitate the assessment of data quality. This
willgiveacompleteandclearpictureofthesuitabilityofthedeviceforthetaskathand. Fur-
thermore, sharing raw data across different research sites and groups can enhance the value
ofthedataset,advancetheunderstandingofdatacomplexities,andfacilitatescientificexplo-
ration of the data. Another important tool to effectively assess data value is the use of data

Gaps in the data can be caused by several issues related to data collection. A common
cause of data loss is the limited battery life of the device. Charging the battery takes time

Anothercommonsourceofdatalossisconnectionproblemswithwirelessdatastreaming.
With a Bluetooth connection, the maximum range between the wearable and its companion
device is usually 10m within the same room. Whenever a wearable device is disconnected, it
needstoautomaticallyreconnectandtransferanybuffereddata,otherwise,anydatacollected
while the device is disconnected will be lost. The Empatica E4 device used in the studies

Finally, data gaps can be introduced by human interaction. Taking the device off for a
shorttime,forexample,duringashowerorneuroimagingcausesseveralminutesofdataloss.
Incorrect operation of the device can also lead to lost data. Some of these causes for data
incompleteness can be avoided, for example, by the careful preparation of a study protocol
detailing proper usage of the device. Others are inevitable, and some gaps in the data set are
unavoidable.
Data coverage was determined in two different categories: the overall data coverage and
thenumberofmissedseizuresduringeachpatient’srecording. Datacoverageiscomputedby
countingthenumberofsamplespermodalitycollectedfromthewearabledevice,perpatient,

Among patients who wore the Empatica E4 device in the UKF and KCL sites, the average

Data quality is an important property for any scientific data set. The quality of data col-

If the device was not tightly fastened around the wrist, the actual BVP data for that segment
are not recoverable. This can be a considerable problem for data collection during physical
activity or during convulsive seizures. Another source of poor data quality is inaccuracies
introducedbythesensor,forexample,causedbyfaultyordeterioratedhardware.
To measure data quality, numerous methods can be found in existing literature, and are
usually specific to a certain sensor modality [159, 212, 257, 300, 301]. Figure 3.2 shows a plot

an important part of any study and should follow a defined protocol and refer to specific
standards [212]. Sensitivity and specificity are the two cornerstones of reporting results of
binary classification, especially in a medical context. Sensitivity, also often called recall in
a machine learning context, measures the proportion of true positives (TPs) to all expected
positiveinstances. Itmustalwaysbereportedasastudyoutcome,becauseforseizuredetection
it directly describes the respective methodology’s ability to robustly detect seizures from the
wearabledata. Ontheotherhand,specificitymeasurestheproportionoftruenegativestoall
expected negative instances. To report measures like specificity based on negative instances
in the context of wearable seizure detection, the data stream must be segmented into equal-
sized portions of either the seizure or non-seizure class. Due to the large data imbalance of
these two classes that is usually observed in epilepsy studies, with sometimes multiple days
of non-seizure portions in the data interrupted only by often minute-long seizure portions,
the specificity measure is artificially boosted to consistently report values of, for example,
>98%, even if there are many false positives (FPs). Because of this lack of informative value,
specificityisoftenomittedwhenreportingontheperformanceofaseizuredetectionsystem.
Instead,thefalsealarmrate(FAR)orpositivepredictivevalue(PPV)canbereportedasinverse
measuresofaseizuredetectionsystem’sabilitytocorrectlyidentifynon-seizureperiods. The
FAR reports the number of false detections over a certain timespan, often chosen as a day
(24h). For example, a FAR of 0.5 per 24h would mean that the system, on average, produces
one false alarm every 2 days. FAR can also be separately reported for daytime and nighttime
periods,asfalsenocturnalalarmsmaybemuchmoredisruptingandlessacceptabletopatients
and caregivers. The PPV, also often called precision in a machine learning context, is the
proportion of TPs to all detected positives. It thus gives a measure of the number of FPs to
TPs, for example, a PPV of 50% would describe a result of the same number of FPs as there
are TPs. At least one of these measures, FAR and PPV, must always be reported as a study
outcome, to properly convey the number of FPs a system is likely to produce. One possible
waytocounteractfalsealarmscouldbetoaskpatientstoperformspecificperiodicmovements

The Empatica E4 supports two data acquisition modes: a local storage recording mode
and a Bluetooth streaming mode. The two modes are mutually exclusive; If the device is
connected to a Bluetooth device no data will be recorded on the internal storage. In local
storage mode, the data are stored on an internal device memory and will be transferred to a
WindowsorMacapplicationrunningonanexternalcomputerwhenevertheE4isconnected
to it by Universal Serial Bus cable. The raw data are however not directly accessible at this
stage, and are transferred by internet connection to cloud-storage servers operated by the
devicemanufacturer,tobeviewedanddownloadedviaanonlinedatadashboard.
Alternatively, the device can be connected via Bluetooth to an app running on a mobile
device,whichinturnreadspreviouslystoredorcurrentlystreamingdataanduploadsthemto
the same manufacturer-controlled servers. In addition, software development kits (SDKs) are
available for the Android and iOS platforms to develop a custom data streaming application.
For the realization of the studies such an application was used, avoiding the usage of third-
party cloud storage (see Section 3.2.2). While in streaming mode, the Empatica E4 does not

3.2.2 Implementation of Data Collection
In conjunction with the centerpiece of the data collection, the Empatica E4 wearable device,
several other systems were deployed to facilitate biosignal data acquisition1 [291, 302]. As a
direct companion to the wearable, an Android device2 was used to run a custom open-source
application that connects to the wearable by Bluetooth. Furthermore, a data ingest and pro-
cessinginfrastructurewasdeployedonaservermachine,handlingthedatacollectedandsent
by the app via standard wireless network connection. The raw data were then stored on a
network-attachedstorageserverinhuman-readable,comma-separatedtextfilesforlaterpro-
cessing and analysis. Figure 3.4 gives an overview of the full data collection pipeline, as also
furtherdescribedinthefollowing.
The Android app uses a SDK provided by the manufacturer to connect to the E4, receive
new raw data, and decode them from a binary format to appropriate floating-point numbers.
The Empatica E4 sends data in batches, which the app receives together with a time stamp
per sample that derives from the wearable’s internal real-time clock. This clock is updated
to the current time of the Android companion device only at the start of each connection
session. Theappthencollectsallofthesesamplesofrawdata,groupedbybiosignalmodality,

3.2.3 Data Preprocessing
All data processing and analysis performed in the studies included in this thesis was done
usingMATLAB,developedbyMathWorksInc,Natick,MA,USA,indifferentsoftwareversions
dependingonthemostrecentreleaseversionavailableatthetime. Afterrawsensordatawere
collected from study participants, several preprocessing procedures were applied in order to
prepare the data for further analysis, for example, feature extraction (see also Section 1.3.3).
The specific actions relevant to the analysis performed here were deduplication of data sam-
ples,correctionoftimestampdrift,anddiscoveryofviabledatablocks.
The timestamps attached to each sample of wearable data, both the native E4 stamp and
the Android OS time, are given as Unix time1, that is, the number of seconds elapsed since
1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. Here,the timestamps arenumbers infloating-point for-
matatmillisecondprecision. TherawEmpaticaE4datacansometimescontaintwodatasam-
ples with the exact same timestamp, due to unknown device-internal reasons. Data analysis
methodologies generally expect time series data to be unique with respect to sample times-
tamps. Thus, immediately after reading the data into memory, samples with the same times-
tampastheonebeforeitwereremoved.
As outlined in Section 3.1.2, inaccuracies in the real-time-clock circuits of wearable de-
vicesmayleadtosomedifferencesbetweenthedevicetimeandtherealtime(orvEEGtime).
The two times may drift apart by several seconds over multiple hours of recording, and the
rate of drift is not necessarily linear and not the same for different E4 devices. Furthermore,
since the E4 device does not allow a regular automatic synchronization of the internal device
timewithsomeexternaltimesource,therecordedtimestampsneededtobecorrectedretroac-
tively. To this end, the timestamp drift was estimated to be linear over short timespans and
betweenpointsofgreaterthannormalchangeintime. Thedriftitselfwascalculatedbytaking
the difference between the Empatica E4 and Android OS reference time, which was regularly
synchronized with the internal vEEG time. The estimated short-term linear segments of the
drift were then subtracted from the same, resulting in new timestamps for each sample that
are in line with the reference time, within a margin for error of less than one second. Fig-
ure 3.5 gives an example of this procedure for a multi-day Empatica E4 recording, including
several disconnects and reconnects showing as jumps of the drift to zero due to the one-time

reliably provide data from all sensors at all times during the recording. In fact, the raw data
set contains several sometimes hour-long periods where data of one modality is present, but
not of another. These gaps were furthermore found to always be larger than one second.
Thus, to facilitate efficient analysis, gap-less data blocks including full data from all three
relevant biosignal modalities (ACC, EDA, BVP) were discovered. To this end, the raw data

spect to feature extraction and seizure detection were distinctive per analysis, and are fur-
ther explained in each respective part of the thesis. The data collection studies referenced in
this thesis were conducted at two European epilepsy centers, the University Medical Center
FreiburgandtheKing’sCollegeHospitalLondon.

seizure detection, as compared to convulsive seizures. Here, convulsive tonic-clonic seizures
and focal seizures with motor components were the target of seizure detection, and as such
the Empatica E4 wearable device was considered to be the best choice. Furthermore, patients
with known motor seizures of any kind were included as participants in the studies, whereas
patients with a history of only non-motor semiologies were not included in the subsequent
dataanalyses.
The Empatica E4 is a research-grade wrist-worn wearable certified as a medical device
for epilepsy monitoring, and provides access to the raw data of the biosignal modalities ac-
celerometry, electrodermal activity, and blood volume pulse (BVP), which were used in the
seizure detection methodologies presented here. Study participants also underwent video-e-
lectroencephalography (vEEG) monitoring at the two epilepsy centers the studies were con-
ducted at. Epileptologists created expert annotations of seizure onset and offset times as well
as type and included semiologies, serving as a ground truth for the evaluation of the seizure
detection algorithms. The wearable data were collected via an open-source Android appli-
cation and server infrastructure, with the E4 device streaming data via Bluetooth. The raw
data time series were synchronized to the vEEG data in a preprocessing step, among other

patients with epilepsy in terms of incidence and prevalence, are among the most dan-
gerous, and also widely known, seizures that can occur. With regard to automatic seizure
detectionwithwearables,earlywarning,alarm,andautomateddiarysystemsareallrelevant
in some way. This thesis, however, focuses primarily on the context of seizure diaries. Both
generalizedtonic-clonicseizuresandfocaltobilateraltonic-clonicseizuresareincludedinthe
studies presented here, considered to be reasonably straightforward to detect with data from
wearablebiosignalsensors.
The first part of this chapter includes a study centered around the assessment of a con-
vulsive seizure detection methodology, employing features from accelerometry (ACC) and
electrodermal activity biosignal data and a boosting ensemble machine learning model. The
evaluation shows that the technique performs at least as good as some of the current best
publisheddetectionsystemsinsimilarcontexts.
The second part of the chapter examines the possibility to use wearables to detect and
monitorpost-ictalimmobility,astateofunconsciousnessandnomovementthatoftenoccurs
after patients have had a convulsive seizure and can foreshadow sudden unexpected death in
epilepsy (SUDEP). A simple heuristic approach based on ACC data can robustly detect this

Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurological diseases, with a reported yearly
worldwideincidenceofmorethan60per100,000individuals[15]. Epilepsyalsohasaremark-
ably diverse set of indications, with several different types of symptoms and characteristic
seizuresofvaryingseverity. Seizuresareusuallydistinguishedbytheironsetinthebrain,focal
or generalized. They can involve a variety of different combinations of symptoms, including
impaired awareness or loss of consciousness; cognitive, emotional, or sensory abnormalities;
sudden changes in the autonomic nervous system; or motor manifestations such as spasms,
automatisms,ortonicandclonicmovementsofthelimbs[27]. Theseconvulsiveseizures,par-
ticularlyfocaltobilateralorgeneralizedtonic-clonicseizures(TCSs),arethemostdangerous
type of epileptic seizures. They imply loss of consciousness and loss of motor control with
considerable risk for physical harm and can transition to life-threatening status epilepticus or
suddenunexpecteddeathinepilepsy[303].
For the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy, clinicians rely on patient self-reporting and
structured diaries, counting the number of seizures a patient had in a certain time frame.
However, personal diaries filled out by the patients themselves have been proven to be very
unreliable, with frequent undercounting because of a lack of awareness of seizures [54, 304].
Anobjectiveseizurediaryisthereforeneededtoobtainvaliddataonseizureoccurrence,con-
tributingtoimprovedguidanceforthetreatmentofpeoplewithepilepsy. Wearablenon-elec-
troencephalography (EEG) devices (wearables) could provide data for such a diary. They are
discreetandunobtrusive,contrarytomanywearableEEGdevicesthatareoftencumbersome
and stigmatizing [305], although some less obtrusive wearable EEG systems are in develop-
ment [119, 306]. Moreover, a robust detection of convulsive seizures with wearables, paired
with identification of seizure-related risk factors [105], could be of great clinical importance
and provide essential information for the identification of seizure-related sudden unexpected
deathinepilepsyriskfactors.
Although seizure detection with non-EEG wearables is a relatively new field in epilepsy
research, there have already been some studies that have demonstrated the viability of this66 CHAPTER4. DETECTIONOFMAJORCONVULSIVESEIZURES

Objective
In this study, an automatic seizure detection system for TCSs is presented, using supervised
machinelearningthatisstraightforwardtoimplementandreproduce. Thedetectionmodelis
evaluated on a newly recorded data set from a multicenter clinical study with wearable non-
EEG devices. Finally, the detection system, its performance, and its limitations are discussed
andanoutlookofpossiblefurtherapplicationsforthisdetectionapproachareconcluded.

between which they changed twice daily to ensure continuous recordings. The wearable de-
vice recorded 3-axis accelerometry (ACC) at a sample rate of 32Hz, electrodermal activity
(EDA)at4Hz,andphotoplethysmography(PPG)at64Hz,whichwasprocessedonthedevice
to a blood volume pulse signal. Participants generally wore the device on the arm that was
most involved in motor semiology during seizures, that is, the arm that presented the most
substantial movements. In the set of 10 participants with TCSs included here, each wore the

Features
AnextensivefeaturesetwascreatedfromtheACCandEDAsignals,encompassing141ACC
and 10 EDA features, at sliding window sizes of 2, 10, and 20 seconds for the ACC features,
and 5, 10, and 20 minutes for the EDA features. PPG signals were not analyzed in this study
because of major ictal movement artifacts resulting from the convulsive TCSs. Although ar-
tifacts in PPG data can still convey information, in that the presence of noise itself can be
information, the choice was made to omit it here in favor of focusing on the other 2 biosig-
nals,becausetheinformationofPPGmotionartifactsisnaturallyincludedintheACCsignal
aswell. TheACCfeaturesincludedavarietyofdifferenttimeandfrequencydomainfeatures.
The EDA features represented the skin conductance level (SCL), that is, tonic low-frequency
EDAchanges,andskinconductanceresponserate(SCRR),thatis,phasicorhigher-frequency
EDAchanges,calculatedagainstabaseline.
As detection models usually perform most effectively with smaller feature sets, both in
terms of computational cost and prediction performance [307], the number of used features
wasreducedconsiderably. Forthisfeatureselection,relatedliteratureinthefieldofwearable
seizure detection was consulted to narrow down window sizes that effectively capture rele-
vantsignalchangesintimeandidentifyfeaturetypesthatweresuccessfullyusedpreviously.
Thereby, a window of 10 seconds for the ACC features was selected [214, 215, 224], and a
longer window of 5 minutes for the EDA features to capture the tonic changes in the EDA
signalthatevolveoverlongerperiods[153]. Thefeaturedatawerethenvisualizedinaperiod
around the seizure, overlaid over each other, and for all features separately. In addition, the
mean and standard deviation (SD) for each data series was plotted. The data that were used
for these graphs were taken only from the seizures of participants that were not included in
the test set to be used in the out-of-sample performance evaluation (see Section 4.1.3). Fea-
tures showing recurrent typical ictal changes were then visually selected for further analysis

representationofthefeaturecomputationmethodology.
SeizureDetection
A gradient boosted decision trees (GBT) model [309] was used as the detection model for the
TCSs. Although similar to the well-known random forest (RF) method in being a set of trees
that are grown with training data, a GBT model builds trees as weak learners in an additive
manner. The model is improved with each new weak learner that is added to the ensemble,
whereastheRFmodeltrainsalltreesinparallelandindependentofeachother. Weaklearners
in this case are trees with a very low number of splits, down to decision stumps with just 1
split. ThisresultsinanoveralllowerbiasandsimilarvarianceforGBTmodelscomparedwith
RF models at the cost of higher parameter tuning effort. Therefore, GBT models generally
perform better than RF models if tuned sufficiently, and they have been successfully used in
machine learning problems [95]. To tackle this tuning effort, a hyperparameter optimization
was performed over several of the model parameters in a leave-one-participant-out (LOPO)
manner. To this end, the data set was split into a training set and a test set. The training set
consisted of the 10min peri-ictal data of 10 TCSs from 8 patients with epilepsy recruited at
theFreiburgsite. Thebasictestsetconsistedofthecompletedatafrom2patients,1fromthe
Freiburgsiteand1fromtheLondonsitewith11TCSs(seeSection4.1.3). Thehyperparameter
optimization only used the training set to keep the test set unknown to the model before
testing. All feature data were normalized between −1 and 1 before training and testing. For
training, the combined feature input for the model, that is, the peri-ictal feature data of 10
TCSs, were normalized, and for testing the complete feature data from the recordings for a
participant were normalized independent of the feature data of the other participants in the
testset.
ThehyperparameteroptimizationwasperformedinaLOPOnestedcross-validationman-
ner on the training set. The data for 1 of the 8 participants in the training set were kept back
as a validation set, and the model was trained on the seizures from the other 7 participants,
usingonly10minperi-ictaldataforeachseizure. Thisreductionofthetrainingdatatoonlya
small period around seizures helps with the large imbalance in the data set when comparing
ictal and non-ictal epochs. Once the model was trained, it was then tested on the complete

thehyperparameteroptimizationprocess.
Furthermore, the GBT model also had some fixed parameters that were the same for all
optimization runs. The boosting method used in the model was adaptive boosting for binary
classification [310], and the misclassification cost for false negatives was always 1. The hy-
perparameter optimization resulted in an optimal set of parameters that were subsequently
usedinallthetestingsteps. Theoptimalparametercombinationwaschosenasthecombina-
tion that achieved the highest sensitivity and lowest false alarm rate (FAR) during the LOPO

Evaluation
Toprocessthemodeloutputandscoreitsperformancewhencomparedwiththegroundtruth,
the same method was used both in the validation during hyperparameter optimization and
later during the testing phase (see Section 4.1.3). Owing to the method of feature extraction
at fixed time intervals of 2 seconds, the output of the GBT model is a prediction vector con-
tainingthepredictedlabelevery2seconds. Theinputlabels,thatis,thegroundtruth,andthe
predictedlabelswerebinary,denotingtheclassificationofeach2-secondintervaltoeitherbe-

can be done sample-wise by comparing each 2-second interval, or event-wise, by combining
consecutiveintervalsofthepositiveclasstodistinctevents. Inthisanalysisthelattermethod

First,thepredictionoutputofthemodelwassmoothedwithahysteresis-likefiltertoavoid
single-sample positives or gaps in consecutive positive predictions. To this end, all gaps be-
tween consecutive positive predictions smaller than 20 seconds in duration were filled out as
positive,thuscreatingcontinuous,longereventsfromshortneighboringpositivepredictions.
Thereafter, all consecutive positive predictions of a certain length were discarded. This value
was chosen to be 4 seconds, as it provides a good balance between discarding short, single-
sample predictions and still keeping possible relevant events. Thus, the prediction output of
the model can be matched to the ground truth per participant by counting overlaps of pre-
dictedpositiveeventswithapositivegroundtrutheventastruepositives(TPs)andpredicted
positive events with no overlaps in the ground truth as false positives (FPs). The number of
false negatives is then the difference between TPs and the number of seizures a participant

4.1.3 Results
Overview
For the study presented here, only study participants with focal to bilateral or generalized
TCSs were included. This resulted in a data set of 21 TCSs from 10 participants, 9 from the
Freiburg site with 19 seizures captured, and 1 from the London site with 2 seizures captured.
The mean length of convulsive motor phenomena was 64 (SD 23) seconds. Table 4.2 lists the
clinical and demographic information of the participants. They were 40% (4/10) female and
on average 32.7 (SD 11.2) years old. The etiology of epilepsy for 2 participants was unknown
at the time of recruitment. A total of 1 participant was diagnosed with generalized epilepsy,
andtheother9werediagnosedwithfocalepilepsy. Forallcapturedseizures,wearabledevice

Cross-validationTraining
The training set used for hyperparameter optimization included 10 seizures from 8 partici-
pants and covered 414.7h of wearable device data. With the best parameter combination, as
described above, the LOPO cross-validation could detect all 10 seizures (sensitivity = 100%)
with a total of 8 FPs (FAR = 0.46 per 24h). The FP rate was calculated as the ratio of total
FPs across all participants to the number of hours of recordings multiplied by 24, and not the
mean FAR across participants. In the training set LOPO cross-validation, 75% (6/8) of FPs
wereproducedfromthedataof1participantand2byanother. Thus,theother6participants
were free of FPs. All 8 FPs detected by the model during the LOPO cross-validation occurred
when the patient was off camera, for example, in the morning or evening when they were in
thebathroomfortheirdailywashingroutine.72 CHAPTER4. DETECTIONOFMAJORCONVULSIVESEIZURES

andtheotherfromtheFreiburgsitewith9seizuresrecorded,foratotalof197.9hoftestdata.
Thechoiceoftrainingandtestsetwasdeliberate: Withtherelativelylownumberofseizures
and their distribution among participants in this data set, the goal was to train on as many
participants as possible while also having approximately the same number of seizures in the
testset. Thisallocationensuresamodelthatisnotpatientspecificwhilekeepingthetraining

The GBT model with the optimal parameters and trained with all 10 seizures from the
training set could detect 10 of the 11 seizures in this test set (sensitivity = 91%), without any
FPs. However, this test set was limited in that it was biased towards participants who had
convulsive seizures. Therefore, the test set was expanded to also include data from all 30
patients with epilepsy recruited at the London site that had data recorded with the wearable
device. Although this does not add more seizures to the test set for the model to detect, it
doesaddaconsiderableamountofdata,improvingtheassessmentwithrespecttotheFPrate.

The duration of detected seizures was significantly correlated with the vEEG-based seizure

In a Pearson correlation test, the correlation coefficient was r = 0.55, with P = 0.01. In

true duration, with a mean identified duration of 29 (SD 15) seconds versus the mean seizure

4.1.4 Discussion
PrincipalFindings
TheresultsshowthattheGBTmodelcanrobustlydetectTCSsfromnon-EEGwearabledevice
data. A sensitivity of 100% (10/10) on the training set during a LOPO cross-validation, a
sensitivity of 91% (10/11) on the out-of-sample test set, and a FAR of less than 1 per 5 days
in more than 1800h of data indicates a sufficient robustness of this methodology to consider
it in designing an automated seizure diary. A large percentage of FPs occurred in a small
percentage of participants, with most other participants showing between 0 and 0.5 FPs per
day. Furthermore, in participants of the test set who had TCSs, no FPs were reported by
the model. In addition, all true detections of the model occurred within the ictal period of
the respective seizure, showing that the system has high accuracy. Evaluating a test set that
includesdatalargelyfrom1site(London),whilethemodelwastrainedexclusivelywithdata
fromtheothersite(Freiburg),showsthegeneralizabilityofthemodel.
Although the data set contains continuous circadian data, most TCSs occurred during
nighttime sleep. In the training set, 50% (5/10) of seizures occurred while the patient was4.1. DETECTIONOFTONIC-CLONICSEIZURES 75

awake, and in the test set, only 9% (1/11) occurred during wakefulness. Of these 6 awake
seizures, 2 seizures occurred when the patient was outside the bed. All TP detections, both
in the training set LOPO cross-validation and in the test set evaluation, occurred within the
ictal phase of the respective seizure. Conversely, all FP detections occurred when the patient
wasawakeandactive,andmostofthemoccurredduringdaytime. Patientsweregenerallynot
confined to their beds but rather to their hospital rooms. They could freely perform a variety
ofactivitiesofdailyliving,suchasstrollingacrosstheroom,goingtothebathroom,brushing
their teeth, eating and drinking, and washing themselves. Movement patterns during these
activities, particularly if repetitive, could resemble those during convulsive seizures and may
beacommonsourceofFPdetections. However,falsealarmsduringtheseactivitieswhenthe

the model was trained properly on both the ACC and EDA features and that both modalities
contributed to the model’s classification of seizure occurrence. Thus, the misclassification of
1 event was due to atypical raw data and confirmed that the model included EDA features in
itsclassification.
A possible explanation for the unusual EDA signal during this seizure could be that the
EDA electrodes lost adequate contact with the skin, and it was not fully re-established after
theseizure. Thiscouldbecausedbyanimproperlywornwearabledevice,oralossofcontact

It is shown that results of this quality can be achieved with a relatively basic methodology,
which is described in greater detail here, making it fully accessible and reproducible. The
methodology may even be transferrable to other diseases with convulsive attacks, such as
paroxysmal dystonia1 or psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Thus, the study described here
could be used as a stepping-stone for further work not only in epilepsy research but also in

Limitations
The methodology for TCS detection described here also introduces some limitations, one of
whichisthelongfeaturewindowusedfortheEDAfeaturecomputation. A5minlongwindow
enabled the inclusion of tonic changes in the EDA signal spanning over multiple minutes
in the post-ictal phase. However, this automatically introduces an inherent detection delay,
as a real-time system would need to first collect these data before being able to extract the

EDA features and detect a potential seizure. Thus, this methodology would not be suited
as a real-time warning system. Another limitation is the constraint of the model to detect
only TCSs. As the model training process relies on data from the accelerometer sensor, non-
motorseizurescannotbedetectedwiththissetofmodalitiesandfeatures. Futureworkwillbe

Furthermore, the performance of the specific model trained here is likely not sufficient to be

which can be infrequent in everyday life. Additional work and more training data would be
needed to create a system that is usable in clinical practice, possibly even shifting to a semi-

One of the most prevalent limitations in many studies in this field is the controlled in-
hospital setting in which wearable device data are collected. Although patients in this study

actively involving the patient through validation and feedback, for example, by giving them
a chance to review seizure diary entries. Nevertheless, transferring this methodology to an
ambulatory setting will require extensive modifications and reevaluation with data recorded
in everyday living situations that include a gold standard for seizure labeling. In any case,
a robust classifier that has a likelihood of working in the field must first be validated in an
inpatient setting to progress to an ambulatory study, and the research presented here takes a

4.2.1 Introduction
Movement analysis based on accelerometry (ACC) signals has shown an overall good perfor-
manceforthedetectionofconvulsiveseizures(generalizedtonic-clonicseizures(GTCSs)and
focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (FBTCSs)) in epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) [312–
315]and,toalesserextent,inreal-lifesettings[298]. Apotentialapplicationofmovementsen-

Immediatelyfollowingaseizure,thisphenomenonrepresentsaninterestingclinicalmanifes-
tation,knownaspost-ictalimmobility(PI).PIhasbeenrecognizedbycliniciansformorethan
a century [316], although the pathophysiological1 mechanism has remained largely unclear.
Frequently observed after convulsive seizures, PI has been associated with potentially life-
threatening complications and with sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) [317]. In
addition,PIhasoftenbeenobservedinassociationwithpost-ictalgeneralizedelectroenceph-
alography suppression (PGES) [318–322], an electroencephalography (EEG) pattern recorded
inSUDEPcases[303,323–329].
TheidentificationofPIthroughwearableshasnotyetbeenadequatelyexplored. Because
most convulsive seizures do not lead to SUDEP and the occurrence of a fatal seizure is un-
predictable, the automatic, continuous, long-term identification of risk factors for SUDEP as-
sociated with each individual seizure assumes great clinical importance. In a population at
high risk of SUDEP, this study aims to assess whether ACC could be used as a reliable digital
markerofPIandofitsdurationafterconvulsiveseizures. Inaddition,theassociationofpost-
ictal ACC silence with PGES, and with other physiological and clinical variables associated
withSUDEP,wasinvestigated.

4.2.2 Methods
StudyParticipants
Like the other studies included in this thesis, this study was developed in the context of “Re-
mote Assessment of Disease and Relapse – Epilepsy”, a multicenter study designed to assess
the clinical utility of multi-parametric remote measurement technologies in a clinical popu-
lation with epilepsy, in the hospital and real-world environment [291]. The study population
consistedofconsecutivepatientswithepilepsy(PWEs)whowereadmitted,fordiagnosticrea-
sonsorpresurgicalevaluation,totheEMUateithertheneurophysiologydepartmentatKing’s
College Hospital London, or the Epilepsy Center at the University Medical Center Freiburg.
Participantspresentingwithconvulsiveseizures(GTCSsorFBTCSs)wereincluded.
EthicsApproval
The trial and study procedures were approved by the London Fulham Research Ethics Com-
mittee (16/LO/2209; IRAS project ID216316) and in Freiburg by the Ethics Committee at the
UniversityofFreiburg(538/16). Allparticipantsprovidedwritteninformedconsent.
RecordingsandDataCollection
Measurements: Participants were asked to wear a wrist-worn multimodal device (Empatica
E4, Figure 4.6a; Section 3.2.1; Empatica Inc., Boston, MA, USA) at both sites for the entire du-
ration of their stay in the EMU. Additionally, some participants at the London site were also
askedtowearanupperarm-worndevice(IMECarmband,Figure4.6b). Amongothersensors,
boththedeviceshaveanembeddedthree-axisaccelerometercapturingXYZrawACCatasam-
plingfrequencyof32Hzandanelectrodermalactivity(EDA)sensormeasuringtheelectrical
conductance of the skin through dry electrodes. Both the devices measure the conductance
between two electrodes on the skin by applying a direct current to the stratum corneum1
beneath the electrodes. The sampling frequency for the EDA measured at the ventral side
of the wrist is 4Hz (Empatica E4) and at the ventral side of the upper arm is 256Hz (IMEC
armband). The devices were worn on the nondominant hand. Video-electroencephalography
(vEEG)recordingswereperformedusingaminimumof21scalpelectrodes.
Clinical and Seizure Characteristics: For each patient, demographic and clinical data
(including age at onset of epilepsy, type of epilepsy, seizure frequency, and so on) were col-
lected. For each seizure recorded, data on state of wakefulness (awake/asleep), ictal focus,
duration of the clonic and of the tonic phases, as well as the entire seizure duration were
recorded. Convulsive seizures were classified into three categories according to Alexandre et
al. [330]. Early intervention by a nurse (during the seizure or within the first 5s after seizure
termination),earlyadministrationofoxygen(withoxygenmaskduringtheseizureorwithin
thefirst5safterseizuretermination),andpronepositionatseizureendwerealsoannotated.
Seizure, PGES, and PI Annotation: Two neurologists with EEG expertise reviewed the
vEEG recording independently and manually labeled the start (first EEG or clinical manifes-
tation) and the end of the seizures (EEG end) and the presence/absence, onset/offset, and du-
ration of PI and PGES. A random sample of vEEG was reviewed by both the annotators to

guarantee consistency of the labeling procedures. PGES was defined as the post-ictal gener-
alizedabsenceofelectroencephalographicactivity<10µVinamplitude,allowingformuscle,
movement,breathing,andelectrodeartifacts[327]. SeizurespresentingwithaPGESduration
≥20s were considered at higher SUDEP risk [327]. PI was defined as the post-ictal absence
of movements (allowing for respiratory movements) on the video recording. The duration
of PI was defined as the time from the onset of PI to the onset of the first post-ictal active
non-respiratorymovement[321].
Wearable Devices Data: Raw data from the wrist-worn wearable device (Empatica E4)
were streamed via Bluetooth to an android app during the recordings and collected on a cen-
tralized data server [291], as described in Section 3.2. Raw data from the upper arm device
(IMEC armband) were transferred directly from the device to a laptop via cable at the end of
the recording. Both devices and the vEEG were synchronized with a timeserver at the begin-
ningofeachrecording. Iftherewasstilltimedriftleftonthesignalduringaseizure,theoffset
wasmanuallydeterminedbyvisualcomparisonoftheexpert-labeledvideoandrawdata.
DataAnalysis
Automatic Detection of Post-Ictal ACC Silence: The ACC data immediately around the
seizureeventwereplottedandvisuallyinspected. Theinformationobtainedfromtheplotswas
used to create an algorithm for the automatic detection of the post-ictal ACC silence. Given
the seizure offset marked by clinical experts, the post-ictal ACC silence detection algorithm
markedthe“start”ofthepost-ictalACCsilenceifthemovingstandarddeviationwas< 0.2for
5s. The algorithm then marks the “end” of the post-ictal ACC silence if the moving standard
deviation was ≥ 0.2 for at least 5s. Thereby, the duration of the post-ictal ACC silence was
calculated. The moving standard deviation was calculated over a 5s window with maximal
overlap.
Electrodermal Activity: The EDA was plotted around the seizure for visual inspection.
ToaccountforthetypicallyslowchangesintonicEDA,anadditionalhourofdatabeforeand
after the seizure events was also included in the plots. The analysis of the EDA signal was

to obtain the tonic component of the raw EDA signal. The EDA baseline was computed over
the 60min pre-ictal segment. The start of the EDA response was defined as the point after
the labeled start of the seizure where the filtered EDA signal first reached a value of baseline
+2σ. The end of the response was defined as the point after the start of the response where
thefilteredEDAsignalfirstdroppedbelow80%oftheresponsepeak. TheEDAdurationwas
estimated as the time between start and end of the EDA response. Furthermore, the response
amplitude (EDA amplitude) was defined as the difference between the response peak and the
pre-ictalbaseline.
StatisticalAnalysis
Linear regression was used to analyze the linear pairwise relationship between the automat-
ically detected duration of post-ictal ACC silence and other variables, such as duration of PI,
seizureduration,andothers. Thestrengthanddirectionofthelinearrelationshipbetweenthe
differentpairsofvariableswerequantifiedusingthePearsoncorrelationcoefficient.
Variables with P < .2 at univariate analysis were entered in a multivariate model. A
two-sided Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to assess the relationship be-
tween the duration of the post-ictal ACC silence and binary clinical variables, whereas the
Kruskal-Wallis test was used for categorical variables. To account for multiple comparisons,
the resulting P-values were adjusted using the Bonferroni method. Each test was performed
at a significance level of .05. When seizures were captured with both the devices (Empatica
E4 and IMEC armband), the signals collected from the wrist-worn device (Empatica E4) were
included in the analysis. Moreover, a subgroup analysis on the EDA response captured by
the wrist-worn device, producing better signals, was performed. Data were processed using84 CHAPTER4. DETECTIONOFMAJORCONVULSIVESEIZURES

ParticipantsandSeizureCharacteristics
Twenty-twoconvulsiveseizureswererecordedfrom18studyparticipantsbetweenSeptember
2017andOctober2019. Themeanageofstudyparticipantswas37.1years(standarddeviation
(SD) 12.8). The mean disease duration was 19.8 years (SD 7.4) and the median number of
anti-epilepticdrugs(AEDs)takenwas2(range1-4). Themajorityoftheparticipants(66.7%)
reported ≥ 3 convulsive seizures per year. All were admitted to the EMU for presurgical
evaluation of their pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Eleven patients wore the wrist-worn device,
four the arm band, and three both devices. Thirteen seizures were recorded with the wrist-
worndevice,fivewiththearmbandandfourwithboth.
PIandACCsilence
PI occurred in 20 of 22 seizures (90.9%), whereas 2 seizures were followed by post-ictal ag-
itation and confusion. PGES occurred following 15 seizures (75.0%) and it was ≥20s in 11
(55.0%),whichwereconsideredathigherSUDEPrisk.

an example of the post-ictal ACC silence detected by the algorithm and its correspondence

ACC signals captured during the same seizure by the two different devices and the similar
performance of the algorithm on the two different body sites. Occasionally, the post-ictal
ACC silence lasted beyond the PI labeled by experts, as very subtle movements of the hands4.2. POTENTIALUSEOFTONIC-CLONICSEIZUREDETECTION 85

4.2.4 Discussion
ACCsensorsbuiltintoconsumerelectronicssuchassmartwatcheshavebeenwidelyusedfor
the identification of convulsive seizures at rest [134], additionally demonstrating good cor-
relation with seizure motion duration [224]. This study demonstrated a novel application of
wearable ACC. In a population at high risk of SUDEP, represented by patients with refrac-
toryepilepsy,potentiallycandidatesforepilepsysurgery,andwithalargemajorityreporting
more than three or more convulsive seizures per year, wearable ACC was an accurate digi-
tal marker of PI and of its duration after convulsive seizures. Both these functions certainly4.2. POTENTIALUSEOFTONIC-CLONICSEIZUREDETECTION 87
assume a great clinical value, providing information to identify and characterize potentially
life-threatening seizures. In fact, although immobility following a convulsive seizure is a fre-
quent post-ictal event, the occurrence of PI has been regarded as a precipitating factor for
post-ictalcardiorespiratorydysfunctioninrecordedSUDEPcases[303,323–329]. Inthesame

ThereisanurgentneedforappropriatemarkerstodelineateindividualriskofSUDEPand
to track the evolution of risk factors that might predispose to SUDEP over time [331]. The

states,suchasprolongedimmobility,isastepforwardinthisdirection.
Alongside its role as a marker of PI, the post-ictal ACC silence was also correlated with
other known SUDEP risk factors. The duration of the post-ictal ACC silence was correlated
linearly with the age of study participants. This finding is of interest as age is known to
affecttheoccurrenceofseizure-relatedautonomicresponses[332–334]andmayplayarolein
autonomicdysregulation-supportedphenomena,suchasSUDEP.Notably,theaverageriskof
SUDEPisagedependent,rangingfrom0.2/1000PY1 inchildrento1.2/1000PYinadults[19].
However, the correlation of PI with age has not been explored and additional investigations
andlargersamples,includingchildrenwithepilepsy,arerequiredtoconfirmthisobservation.
A long post-ictal ACC silence indicated the presence of seizures followed by PGES ≥20s
(P = .037),carryingahigherriskofSUDEP[327],andalinearcorrelationwashighlightedbe-
tween the duration of post-ictal ACC silence and the duration of PGES (P = .033). However,
the moderate coefficient found (r = .4) suggests that a nonlinear relation may exist between
thesevariables,anddifferentmodelsshouldbeinvestigatedinlargerdatasets. Moreover,the
linear correlation disappeared in the multivariate model, probably due to the presence of a
correlation between PGES and PI durations. These findings are consistent with, and repli-
cate, previous studies analyzing the relationship between PI and PGES, where seizures asso-
ciated with PGES had a longer duration of immobility as compared to those not followed by
PGES[318,319].
Noassociationwithseizuredurationanddurationoftheclonicortonicphasewasfound.
The lack of association between PI and seizure duration was first reported by Gowers [335]
in 1881 and confirmed in later studies [320, 321]. With some exceptions [322], additional
observationsdemonstratednocorrelationwitheitherthedurationoftheconvulsivephaseor

surge of EDA in the peri-ictal period is an index of sympathetic over-activation [150] that
mayberelevantinthepathogenesisofSUDEP[43,153,336].
As hypothesized in previous literature [331], the findings presented here reinforce the
idea that the combination of multiple biosignals, such as post-ictal ACC silence and EDA,
could increase the possibility of identifying seizures, and likewise PWEs potentially carrying

4.2.5 Limitations
This study is limited in several aspects, which are highlighted in the following. The small
sample of patients and seizures may limit the generalizability of findings, which need to be
interpretedwithcautionandreplicatedinlargercohortsandinreal-lifesettings. Nevertheless,
the small cohort included here is certainly of interest given that it is potentially at higher
risk for SUDEP due to its characteristics. Moreover, the automatic detection of PI presented
heredepends ontheprior markingofthe precedingconvulsiveseizure. Thus,in areal-world
system, this methodology would need to be preceded by an independent automatic seizure
detection. ThislimitationisfurtherexploredinSection4.3.
PI was defined as the post-ictal absence of movements, allowing for respiratory move-
ments that are not detectable with wearable ACC and cessation of which is relevant for pos-
sibleSUDEPevents. However,theevidenceonhowPIcontributestoSUDEPisuncertainand
not exhaustive. It is likely that the absence of body movements represents an “early stage”
of total cessation of movements (including respiratory movements), and that the automatic
identification of such an “early sign” (alone or, preferably, in association with tools to detect
hypoxemia)maybeclinicallysignificant.

the simultaneous use of video and automated analysis. Video has been used as a sensitive
waytoquantifymovement[269]andcouldenableremotedetectionofPI.However,although

The duration of post-ictal ACC silence sometimes lasts beyond the PI labeled by experts.

However,thesemovementsweremainlyhand,finger,orneckmovements,whicharecertainly

4.3 Summary
This chapter investigated the detection of convulsive tonic-clonic seizures and related clin-
ical manifestations. Convulsive seizures such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures and focal
to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures are what popular culture typically refers to when portray-
ing an epileptic seizure, and they are among the most high-profile and dangerous seizure
types in terms of their semiology. This, on the other hand, also potentially makes them the
most straightforward to detect using biosignals captured by typical wearable sensors. High-
amplitudeandhigh-frequencymovementsarerepresentedinaccelerometry(ACC)signalsas

The first part of the chapter presents a convulsive seizure detection pipeline, employing
an ensemble machine learning model (gradient boosted decision trees) trained with features
fromACCandEDAbiosignaldata. Fromadatasetof10participantsfromtwoclinicalcohorts

The second part of the chapter highlights a specific clinical manifestation of convulsive
TCSs, post-ictal immobility (PI), a period of unconsciousness occurring after such a seizure
that can be a major risk factor regarding sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). An
automatic detection of this period could facilitate an alarm system, potentially alerting care-
takersthatthepatientisunconsciousafteraseizureandneedsimmediatecare. In20casesof
PIfrom18studyparticipantstheheuristicalgorithmbasedonACCsignalswasabletoidentify
all events, showing significant correlation between the detected and the true length of the PI
period. The continuous detection of risk factors associated with seizures is of great clinical
importance,andthestudyshowsthatwearablesmaybeausefultoolforthistask.
The two studies, while at first glance are both focused specifically on convulsive TCSs,
are not immediately compatible. The identification of PI is based on prior knowledge of the
occurrence of a convulsive seizure, and so a potential SUDEP warning system would need
to be extended by an automatic seizure detection. The detection methodology presented in
the first part is however not entirely applicable as the detection delay caused by the choice
of features from the multimodal biosignal data makes it impracticable for this purpose. Most
essentially, the long-term feature calculation window of 5min into the future for the EDA
features introduces a delay that is likely to be longer than the seizure itself. The long EDA

into account only the quick response to a peak value and not the slow minute-long decline

chapter, only those focal seizures are involved that encompass motor symptoms, specifically
tonic or clonic movements of the limbs. Other focal seizure types, particularly those without
any movements, require separate analysis and potentially the use of other combinations of

5.1.1 Introduction
The few wearable devices that thus far have been used in epilepsy research are most com-
monly smartwatch-like devices or fitness trackers that record biosignals such as accelerom-
etry (ACC), electrodermal activity (EDA), blood pulse via photoplethysmography (PPG), and
electromyography (EMG). These biosignals have been shown to give sufficient indication to-
wards epileptic seizures, with research focusing on monomodal and multimodal detection of
generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs). GTCSs are one type of seizure that involves both
hemispheres of the brain and present themselves in violent bilateral muscle contractions of
the whole body. These are very different from focal seizures (FSs), which start in only one
brain hemisphere and can present themselves in a number of different symptoms that are far
harder to characterize. Other research has explored the detection of FSs with wearable data,
howeveramajorityoftheseeffortshavefocusedondetectingaspecifictypeofFSonly,often
byusingasinglemodality.
This work proposes a multimodal approach to detect FSs, which has thus far been a new

lenges that lie ahead, especially in the analysis of the various subtypes of FSs and the impli-

detects 76% of overall GTCSs, with a FAR of 2.5/24h. However, they also distinguished be-
tweenproperlyandimproperlyplaceddevices,reportingthatamongproperlyplaceddevices
100% of GTCSs were detected with a FAR of 1.4/24h. They conclude that proper placement
of the device is important. EDA and ACC signals are used by Poh et al. [153] to detect 94%
of GTCSs in a data set from 80 patients, with a FAR of 0.7/24h. More recently, Regalia et al.
[293] also used EDA and ACC signals to detect GTCSs, attaining a sensitivity of greater than
92% with a FAR between 0.2 and 1 per day on varying data sets of inpatient and outpatient
studies.
Alsoknownaspartialseizures,FSsareseizuresthathavetheirsourceinoneofthebrain’s
hemispheres, as opposed to GTCSs which spread over both. FSs are therefore usually not
accompanied by severe motor reactions of the body like in GTCSs, but rather manifest in5.1. EXPLORATORYANALYSISOFFOCALMOTORSEIZURES 97
a multitude of different symptoms: These can include autonomous reactions like heart rate
increase(tachycardia),dyscognitivefeatureslikeimpairedawarenessorunconsciousness,less
severemotorcomponents,orso-calledauras,whicharesensoryphenomenonssuchasdéjàvu
sensations or dizziness. During the course of one FS, multiple of these symptoms may occur
consecutivelyorsimultaneously.
Inliterature,thedetectionofFSswithwearableshasbeenattractingmoreattentioninthe
recent past. Some research studies have considered single modalities to detect FSs of specific
types. Jeppesen et al. [237] look at heart rate variability from electrocardiography (ECG) for
17 patients, detecting 74% of seizures with their method. Poh et al. [153] on the other hand
useanEDAsensortoanalyzeautonomicchangesduringandespeciallyafterFSsandGTCSs,
concluding that the EDA response after GTCSs is much more severe and prolonged than in
FSs. A different approach is taken by Vandecasteele et al. [74], who compare wearable ECG
and PPG devices in the detection performance of temporal lobe epileptic seizures, which are
atypeofFS.Theyreportsensitivitiesof70%forECGand32%forPPGdetection,withFARs
of2.1/24hand1.8/24h,respectively.
Recently, some studies have also expanded to multimodal detection of FSs. Cogan et al.
[227]proposeamultistageddetectionsystemthatusesheartrate,arterialoxygenation,ACC,
EDA and temperature data, detecting 100% of FSs in the sensor readings from nearly all 10
patients their data set consists of. However, they do not specify further what type of FS they
workedwith,onlyreferringtothedetectedseizuresascomplexpartial,anoldertermforfocal
seizures. The work presented here is most comparable with that of Onorati et al. [224], who
use EDA and ACC data from 69 patients to detect GTCSs as well as FSs, comparing three
different classification methods. Their best performing method reaches a sensitivity of 95%,
with a FAR of 0.2/24h and an F-score of 0.67 in cross-validation. However, their data set of
55convulsiveseizuresonlyincludessixfocalseizures.
Amongtheaboveresearchworks,thereareseveralstudiesinliteraturethatpresentmon-
omodal and multimodal seizure detection on large data sets, however, these are often very
generalized in what seizure types are included. The distinction between GTCSs and FSs is
often made, but subtypes within FSs are rarely investigated or separated in the annotation.
The work presented here illustrates the breadth of FSs by focusing specifically on the multi-

Selectionofthreecases
For the preliminary evaluation presented here, only a select set of participants in the study
is considered from a single site, that is, three representative cases that are to be investigated.
For each of the three patients in question, more than five FSs with varying types of motor
components were recorded, and these patients were selected for their different seizure man-
ifestations: One patient exhibited highly characteristic tonic arm movements that are clearly
distinguishable on the raw ACC signal. The second patient had predominantly automatisms
intheirarms,whichareoftenrandommovementsofthelimbthatcanbeclassifiedasneither
tonic nor clonic. The third patient also had automatisms, however these were not located in
the arms, but rather – more challenging for seizure detection – in the legs and also mouth
region (oroalimentary). Among the three selected patients, a total of 22 seizures had motor
features, and most of them also had autonomic or dyscognitive features, or auras associated
with them. Table 5.1 gives a brief overview of the main characteristics for the three selected
patients. The following evaluation highlights the ACC and EDA data from the Empatica E4
device.

5.1.5 Discussion
Since this is a sample-wise cross-validation, the scores from this evaluation give an overview
oftheperformanceoftheRFmodelwithrespecttotheclassificationofseizurestatusforeach
second in the test data sets; As opposed to event-based classification which would give an
overview of the performance with respect to the classification of overall seizure events. Fur-
thermore,sinceforthissample-basedevaluationthetrainandtestsetsarehighlyunbalanced,
only precision, recall and F1-score are regarded as measures. The imbalance derives from the
choiceofseizuredataset,thatis,dataforoneseizureincludes55minofnegativedatabefore
and after the seizure that typically has a length of <5min, with a mean of 1min 55s for the
selectedseizures,or1.7%comparedtonegativedata.
The performance for P1 is acceptable in data set 1, without the simulation of a post-
detectionpause,andincreasesconsiderablyindataset2,where5minofdataarecutoffafter
a seizure. This behavior is expected, as there often are detections right after the seizure in
data set 1, as can be seen in Figure 5.3. Especially the precision score is affected by this, as
primarily false positive classifications after a seizure are avoided. For P1 the recall score also
improves substantially with data set 2, showing that the detection of clear and characteristic
motorFSsmaybenefitthemostfromthismethod.
Contrarily, for P3 recall scores improve less than precision. Overall however, the seizures

state-of-the-art moves in the direction of individual-invariant models. Furthermore, a sys-

5.2.1 Introduction
Epileptic seizures are defined by a period of abnormal neuronal activity in the brain, and are
generally divided into two main groups by their neurological onset [27]. Seizures with an
early bilateral involvement are called generalized seizures, while seizures with just a single
point of onset are denoted as focal onset seizures, but epileptic activity can propagate across
the brain resulting in “focal to bilateral” seizures with characteristic motor manifestations.
Bilateral tonic-clonic seizures have been assessed in numerous studies as to the viability of
wearables for the detection during recent years, and detection has been demonstrated to be
feasible in multiple retrospective studies [104, 226, 227, 280, 315, 340–343]. Conversely, focal
seizuresingeneralarestillarelativelyunexploredfieldwithrespecttowearablenon-electro-
encephalography (EEG) detection [74, 106, 110, 219, 235, 344]. Symptoms and manifestations
oftheseseizuresaremuchmoreheterogeneousascomparedtothoseofbilateraltonic-clonic
seizures,withsomebarelyornotatallcapturedbytypicalwearablebiosignalmodalities,such
asaccelerometry(ACC),electrodermalactivity(EDA),orphotoplethysmography(PPG).
Focalseizurescanberoughlydividedintotwocategories:thosewithmotorandthosewith-
outmotormanifestations. Non-motorsymptoms,thatis,thosewithoutinvoluntarymovement
ofthebody,mayincludepartiallossofawarenessorconsciousness,cognitiveimpairment,or
emotional or sensory symptoms. Motor symptoms, on the other hand, can include tonic or
clonic movements of the limbs or body in general, hyperkinetic movements, or automatisms.
A single epileptic seizure can thereby be composed of multiple types of manifestations, in
parallelorsequentially.
This work highlights difficulties in the detection of focal onset epileptic seizures, specifi-
callythosewithfocaltonicorclonicmotorsymptomsbutwithoutbilateralpropagation,from
biosignal data captured by wearable devices. A data set consisting of multimodal data from a
wrist-worn wearable was recorded from patients with epilepsy during their in-hospital stay
atanepilepsymonitoringunit(EMU).Classicalsupervisedmachinelearningisappliedinor-
der to assess the utility of this kind of data for the detection of seizures, in the context of
an automated seizure diary. As written diaries created by the patients themselves have been
demonstrated to be very inaccurate and often severely undercount seizures even for convul-

fication and quantification is needed, for example, as a basis for treatment decisions made by
epileptologists. Inthesupervisedmethodologyemployedheredataarefirstlabeled,basedon
parallel video-electroencephalography (vEEG) monitoring, as “seizure” or not “seizure”, and
thenprocessedintomeaningfulfeaturesandgiventothemachinelearningmodelfortraining.
Thus,thetrainedmodelcanthenbeusedtoautomaticallyclassifynewdata. Specifically,this
study uses gradient boosted decision trees (GBT) as the seizure detection model. To evaluate
such an approach, and subsequently also determine the application in a real-world system,
two procedures can be applied: intra-subject or inter-subject evaluation. The intra-subject
evaluation focuses on the performance of the methodology when applied to data from a sin-
glepatient,whiletheinter-subjectevaluationassessestheperformanceovermultiplepatients
with potentially different types of epilepsy and seizure manifestations. The former requires
multiple seizures recorded per subject and will produce individualized models tailored to a
single patient, while the latter requires seizures recorded from multiple different participants
and will give inter-subject models, to be used over wider populations. This study aims to de-
termine which of these approaches may work best for focal motor seizures going forward,

5.2.2 Materials and Methods
DataSet
Data from wearable devices were recorded from a total of 243 patients with epilepsy across
twoEMUsintheperiodbetweenJuly2017andFebruary2020. Bothattheneurophysiological
department of King’s College Hospital London (KCL) (71/243 patients), and at the Univer-
sity Medical Center Freiburg (172/243 patients), patients in the age range of 7 to 80 with a
diagnosis of epilepsy were recruited sequentially as part of their standard clinical epilepsy
care, for example, in the course of standard presurgical evaluation. Patients with predomi-
nantly (suspected) psychogenic non-epileptic seizures or other involuntary movements were
not included in the study. As part of their stay in the EMU study, participants may have had
seizures provoked, for example, by temporary reduction of their anti-epileptic medication or
through other means, such as sleep deprivation or hyperventilation techniques. The vEEG
data were retrospectively reviewed and labeled by clinical experts. Primarily, they marked
seizuretypeandsemiologies,electrographicandclinicalonsetandoffset,andothermetadata
including state of vigilance and body position at seizure onset. While participants wore dif-
ferent kinds of wearable devices, and sometimes more than one in parallel, the retrospective
study presented here only includes data from the wrist-worn Empatica E4 (Figure 5.4; Sec-
tion3.2.1;EmpaticaInc.,Boston,MA,USA).Itisaresearch-gradedevicedesignedspecifically

previous research in the field. The following details the feature calculations for the biosignal
modalities,ACC,EDA,andBVP.
For the ACC features, a number of parameters calculated from the recurrence plot are
used as features. Recurrence plots are a statistical tool to analyze recurrence in time series
data [345, 346], and have been successfully used in the detection of motor movements from
accelerometer data before [104, 308, 347]. Specifically, the determinism (percentage of points
that form diagonal lines of a minimal length), the Shannon entropy (probability that a line5.2. DETECTIONOFFOCALMOTORSEIZURES 107

has a certain length), the average diagonal line length, and the recurrence rate (density of
recurrence points) were calculated from the recurrence quantification analysis. All of these
values are derived from overlapping data windows of a length of 10s, centered at each 2s
interval.
The EDA features used here are calculated from the skin conductance level and the skin
conductance response rate (SCRR) [42, 135, 150, 246]. The former is essentially a low-pass
filtered version of the original raw EDA signal and thus represents the slower tonic changes
in the EDA data. It is represented in the feature set by the difference of area under the curve
and maximum between the five minutes before (feature window) and after (baseline) each
two-secondintervalpoint. Additionally,theSCRRfeatureiscalculatedagainstthebaselinein
thesameway,representingthehigher-frequencyphasicchangesoftheEDAsignal. TheSCRR
is calculated as the number of threshold crossings of the first derivative of the EDA signal in

Evaluation
Toassessthepossibilitiesofdetectingfocalepilepticseizuresbywearablebiosignaldata,two
different approaches were investigated: intra-subject and inter-subject. The distinction is an
importantadditiontothiswork,asfocalmotorseizureshavenotbeeninvestigatedtoadegree
that allows making the choice outright. While an inter-subject approach, that is, creating
models that can detect seizures across a patient population without individual adjustments,
would certainly be the best possible outcome, the heterogeneity of focal seizures may dictate
an intra-subject approach using individualized models. To examine the effect that this might
havewiththegivendataset,theevaluationwasdividedintotwoparts.
Firstly, a subset of participants with at least three focal motor seizures recorded was iso-
lated,andthedetectionmodelwasevaluated perparticipantinaparameter-optimizedleave-
one-seizure-out(LOSO)cross-validation. Asthedatasetdidnotprovidedatawithmorethan5.2. DETECTIONOFFOCALMOTORSEIZURES 109
six seizures recorded for a single participant, or with multiple independent recordings of a
participant, this was performed without a dedicated test set which is truly “out-of-sample”.
Rather, the model was trained with the data of all but one seizure and the respective peri-
ictal data of 10min before and after each seizure. These data were standardized using the
z-score method before training, and the normalization parameters (centering mean and scal-
ing standard deviation) were stored. The resulting model was then tested on the remaining
participantdata,standardizedusingthepreviouslystorednormalizationparametersfromthe
training step. This test data included the complete data set of the participant, including the
left-out seizure, but not any of the data used for training the model. Nevertheless, due to the
highimbalancebetweeninter-ictalversusictalphases,theproportionofdatabetweenthetest
andtrainingsetwastypicallyfargreaterthan10:1. Thisprocesswasrepeatedsuchthateach
seizureoftheparticipantwasleftoutonce.
Secondly, for the inter-subject evaluation, the seizure data from all the participants with
three or more seizures recorded, selected in the first step, were used to validate the per-
formance on data from all the remaining participants with one or two focal motor seizures
recorded. Thereby, the model was first parameter-optimized in a leave-one-participant-out
(LOPO) cross-validation on those training participants. Thus, each of the participants in this
optimization set was omitted from the model training process once and used as a validation
dataset. Themeanperformancescoresoverthecross-validationrunswerethenusedtodeter-
mine the optimal parameter combination. In a second evaluation step, the optimized model,
now trained with all the peri-ictal seizure data from the training subjects, was then applied
to all the data from the test set participants. During the training of this model, the data were
again first standardized using the z-score method, and those normalization parameters were
thenappliedtotheincomingtestdata. Overallthisresultedinamodeltrainedandoptimized

TheGBT[95,309]methodologywaschosenasthemodelusedtodetectictalstates,asitisrel-
ativelystraightforwardinitsapplicationandwasalreadyvalidatedonthesamecohort,albeit
ondatafrompatientswithconvulsiveseizures[104](Section4.1). Duetothismethodology’s
requirementforparametertuningtoachievegoodperformance,hyperparameteroptimization
wasconductedinboththeintra-andinter-subjectevaluations,asdescribedabove.
For the optimization of the intra-subject model, an optimal parameter combination was
found for each of the three included participants by performing a LOSO cross-validation.
Thereby, the model was trained on the data of all but one seizure and the respective peri-
ictal data, and tested on all remaining data including the left-out seizure for that participant,
minus the training data. This was repeated for all seizures, and the performance scores were
averaged. This procedure was then repeated for each combination of parameters. For the
inter-subject evaluation, a similar procedure was implemented for the three selected partici-
pants,butinaLOPOmanner. Themodelwiththebestparametercombinationwasthentested
onout-of-sampledatafrompreviouslyunseenparticipants.
Fourdifferentmodelparameterswereoptimized: thelearningrate,themaximumnumber
ofweaklearners,themaximumtreedepthperweaklearner,andthemisclassificationcostfor
false positives (FPs). Conversely, the misclassification cost for false negatives (FNs) was not
tunedandkeptunweighted,andonlyonetypeofboostingwasused,namelyadaptiveboosting110 CHAPTER5. DETECTIONOFFOCALONSETSEIZURES
for binary classification (“AdaBoost”) [310]. In total, the number of different parameter com-
binations over which the grid search optimization was performed added up to 600. The best
parametercombinationwaschosenastheonewiththehighestsensitivityandlowestnumber
of FPs, in that order. In the case of a tie, the parameter combination with a higher learning
rateorlowernumberoftreeswaschosenasthebestone,asitwouldbecomputationallymore
efficient.
To gauge the influence of the various features on the creation of the model, the feature
importance of each of the optimized models was analyzed. Therefore, the importance scores
for each of the models resulting from the single cross-validation runs was averaged in the
intra-subject LOSO evaluation, resulting in one set of scores per participant included there.
Moreover, for the inter-subject LOPO evaluation, only the importance scores of the optimal
model,trainedonallseizuresfromthoseintra-subjectevaluationparticipants,werenoted. The
feature importance was based on decision tree node impurity, using the Gini diversity index
and calculated such that the smallest possible value was 0 [311, 350]. Thereby, the reported
importance scores for each of the features are the averages over all the trained trees in the
boostingensemblefortheGBTmodel.
PerformanceMeasurement
The main indicators of performance used in this evaluation are the mean sensitivity, false
alarmrate(FAR)per24h(falsealarmrateper24h(FAR24))andpositivepredictivevalue(PPV).
Thesescoreswerecalculatedfromthenumberofoverlapsofseizureeventsinthegroundtruth
andpredictedlabels. Thelabeldata,analogoustothefeaturedata,werestoredat2sintervals,
and seizure events here were defined as consecutive intervals of labels classified as a seizure
of at least 6s and at most 10min. The output of the classification model was furthermore
smoothed before this scoring computation, by filling out gaps between seizure labels of at
most30s,andremovinganyorphanseizurelabels. Afterthisprocessingofthemodeloutput,
it was compared to the ground truth and any overlaps of seizure events were counted as true
positives. Seizure events in the ground truth but not in the detector output were counted as
FNs, and vice versa, seizure events in the output that were not present in the ground truth
were counted as FPs. Note that the comparisons described above are given a 2min margin

During the study recordings, the Empatica E4 device was used in a Bluetooth streaming
mode [103], which unfortunately led to a considerable loss of data due to regular problems
with connectivity of the wearable device to a base device that stores the data. Thereby, more

of seizures, where only those seizures with a duration between 10s and 10min are included.
Limiting the duration of seizures excludes very short seizures of just a few seconds, such as

UKF2, on the other hand, had three focal onset motor seizures recorded with only tonic
manifestations, ictal tachycardia, and miscellaneous awareness during the seizure. Notably
though,allseizuresoccurredwhilethepatientwasawake. Anotherimportantdistinguishing
factor for this participant is that he was only nine years old at the time of enrollment, and as
such the only pediatric patient in the relevant data sets regarded here. Epilepsy in pediatric
patientsgenerallymanifestsindifferentwaysthanforadults[23].
The sole data set from the KCL site, KCL1, had three seizures recorded that match the
criteria for the seizure type. The motor manifestations for them were more heterogeneous
than for the other two participants. All had tonic components, but there were also some oral
automatisms, and one seizure also had clonic components. Furthermore, one seizure did not
prompt ictal tachycardia, and there was a high variance between the seizure durations, with
onebeingover2minandoccurringwhileawake,andtheothertwoonly22s,occurringfrom

5.2.4 Discussion
PrincipalFindings
The main ambition of the evaluation presented here was to qualitatively assess the utility of
multimodal biosignal data from wearables in creating worthwhile and robust seizure detec-
tion systems. Thereby, two principal avenues of potential study design were investigated:
intra-subject and inter-subject schemes. Specifically, this evaluation focuses on focal motor
seizures with tonic or clonic components, as opposed to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. These
focalseizureshaveamultitudeofpossiblephysicalandpsychologicalmanifestationsthatcan
occur in sequence or in parallel, be repeated, or not occur at all, in a single seizure. Further-
more, while there may oftentimes be little change in the semiology of seizures for a single
patient with epilepsy, they can be very heterogeneous across populations [27, 255]. These
circumstances are also reflected in these results. Among the three participants with at least
three seizures recorded, the individually optimized model could robustly recover the left-out
seizuresintheleave-one-seizure-outcross-validationfortwoparticipants.
In one other participant, however, out of three seizures, one could not be restored by the
model when trained on the other two (Table 5.5 and Figure 5.9). These three seizures had
roughly the same semiology with tonic manifestations and ictal tachycardia. In the wearable
data,however,onecleardifferencecanbefoundbetweenthisundetectedseizureandtheother
two;thatis,itshowednodiscernibleEDAresponsebefore,during,oraftertheseizure. Addi-
tionally,thisparticipantUKF2hadanimportantdemographicdifferencetoallotherincluded
participants in this data set, in that they were the only pediatric patient at nine years old.
Age has been linked, for example, to significant changes in seizure semiologies [23]. These

These results suggest that a methodology such as the one presented here, optimized on
individual participants, can robustly detect seizures for some patients with epilepsy, but it
may fail, especially when the seizures have differing semiologies that are not represented in
the training data for the model. Furthermore, when looking at the FAR24 and PPV, the het-
erogeneityoffocalseizuredetectionisespeciallyhighlighted. TheFAR24performanceofthe
seizure detection, ranging from less than one FP per day to almost two FP per hour, is an im-
portant factor when it comes to actually applying the methodology to a real-world setting.
Similarly, this false alarm rate also carries over to the nighttime, with multiple false positives
per night for some participants. Thus, a high sensitivity in detecting seizures is in vain if an
automated seizure diary is filled with dozens of false seizure events per day. Yet, further data
recordingsandmodeloptimizationmayproducerobustseizuredetectionsystemsforindivid-
ualpatients.
Withrespecttotheinter-subjectevaluationacrossmultiplestudyparticipants,theresults
for the methodology applied here further demonstrate the heterogeneity of the focal motor
seizures in this data set, and clearly demonstrate the resulting difficulties. Inter-subject mod-
els applied in a leave-one-participant-out manner to data of the three selected participants
from the intra-subject evaluation performed worse than if trained in an individualized man-
ner,eitherintermsofsensitivityorFAR.Likewise,testingthemodelonout-of-sampledataof

suchasthiswouldbeineffectiveinreal-worldsettings,beitasanautomatedseizurediaryor
an alarm system, and patients’ and caregivers’ needs, in particular, would not be fulfilled [72,
130,131].
Overall,theresultssuggestthatnotonlyarefocalonsetmotorseizuresvariedintheirclin-
ical manifestations, they are also sensitive to changes in common wearable biosignal modal-
ities, when investigated across patients. However, in some individual patients, seizure semi-
ologies are similar enough across seizures to enable robust seizure detection models for less-
severefocalonsetmotorseizures,ifthemodelsareoptimizedinapersonalizedmanner.120 CHAPTER5. DETECTIONOFFOCALONSETSEIZURES

their set of analyzed seizure types was compiled (Table 5.7). The main source of this list was
theextensiveliteraturereviewbyBeniczkyetal.[109],filteredforrelevantseizuretypesand
relevant biosignal modalities that are most closely related to the modalities ACC, EDA, and
PPG. Furthermore, to add some variety, the list includes two recent studies employing wear-
able electromyography- and EEG-based focal seizure detection. All three of the performance
measuresincludedherearecompared,namelysensitivity,FAR24,andPPV.However,asmost
of these works include focal motor seizures as part of a larger group of seizure types, almost
always dominated by generalized and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, the list only in-
cludes three studies where this was possible for all three measures [74, 227, 341]. All three of
these studies classify the focal onset seizures in their respective data sets as complex partial
seizures (CPSs), which is an older type of epileptic seizure classification meaning an interval
withictalimpairedawarenesswithoutgivinginformationaboutmotormanifestationsduring
the seizures. Therefore, it is unclear if, with respect to movements during the seizures, the
seizuretypesinvestigatedintheseworksarecomparabletothoseinthestudypresentedhere.
Moreover,allthreestudiesevaluatedtheirseizuredetectioninaninter-subjectmanneracross

Summarizing the relevant results from these three works, Cogan et al. [227] used a com-
bination of two different wearable devices to record the biosignal modalities EDA, electro-
cardiography (ECG), and blood oxygen saturation, and reported an algorithm sensitivity of
50%withafalsealarmrateof0.28/24h,inCPSonly. Notably,duringtheiranalysistheyalso
lookedintopersonalizationoftheiralgorithm,andconcludedthataminimumof6to8seizures
per patient would be required to sufficiently train and optimize their algorithm parameters,
based on a worst-case scenario. Kusmakar et al. [341] employed ACC sensors in a leave-one-
participant-out inter-subject evaluation and reported a sensitivity of 67% and a FAR24 of 4,
regarding the participants with CPS. They duly concluded that these seizures are much more
similar to inter-ictal data than they are to ictal generalized tonic-clonic seizure data, and as
their data set included only a very small number of CPS, a good performance on this seizure
type was not to be expected. Lastly, Vandecasteele et al. [74] compared two wearable devices
recordingECGandPPG,respectively,andreportedanoverallsensitivityof32%withaFAR24
of 43.2 for the PPG-based wearable device, which was the same as the one used in this study.
They concluded that the PPG-based detection was heavily impeded by motion artifacts even
forthesepossiblynon-generalizedseizures.
Comparingtheseperformances,andfurtherresultsfromotherrelatedworkwhichdidnot
report their outcomes per seizure type or per participant (Table 5.7), to this study’s results
(Table5.6),itbecomesclearthatasensitivityof75%inanindependenttestsetoffocalmotor
seizures is in fact among the top performing methodologies regarding this seizure type only.
Furthermore, works that reported lower numbers of false positive rates also consistently had
lowersensitivities,andsomestudiesthatreportedsimilarnumbersneverthelessstillhadlower
sensitivities. Overall, a comparison of this study’s results to any of these works should be
taken with caution, as this study specifically analyzes focal motor seizures with multi-modal
non-EEGwearabledata.5.2.

ModalityImportance
Overall,thedistributionsoffeatureimportancescores,asaproxyfortheimportanceofbiosig-
nal modalities, seem to be heterogeneous, and no clear winner could be found among the
three examples. The features calculated from the EDA signal, however, seem to be the most
informative with respect to epileptic seizure phases, within this data set of focal onset motor
seizures. This is concurrent with some prior research on generalized seizures as well [223,
293, 351, 352], and suggests that electrodermal activity could be an important clinical marker
of epileptic seizures beyond highly convulsive episodes, which usually induce heavy sweat-
ing. However,itisnotauniversallyapplicablebiomarker,astheseresultsalsosuggest,withat
leastoneparticipantandseveralseizuresexhibitingnosubstantial(post-)ictalEDAresponse,
aswasalsoconcludedinfurtherliteratureonthetopic[42,43,105].
In Glasstetter et al. [348], the authors explored the utility of wearable PPG signals for the
detection of focal onset seizures with ictal tachycardia, and concluded that in some patients
the tachycardia thresholds can be found regardless of seizure-related movements. It seems to
bethecasethatinsomeseizurestheictaltachycardiapresentsitselfsomefewsecondsbefore
the electrographic seizure onset, and could therefore be used as indicators for seizures, albeit
not effectively in a monomodal system. The authors, however, also noted that arbitrary non-
seizure-relatedmovementsmayhinderthisdetectionfromPPGsignalsduetomotionartifacts,
andgenerallypre-ictaltachycardiaseemstobeanisolatedphenomenonnotgeneralizableover
patient cohorts. The results presented here coincide with these conclusions, demonstrating
that BVP features are important only for one of three patients with at least three seizures
recorded.
Limitations
The main limitation of the study and analysis presented here is the limited size of the data
set, with just 20 seizures recorded from nine patients with epilepsy. Unfortunately, publicly
available data sets focusing on classical wrist-worn wearable data which combine movement
and autonomous nervous system biosignals are scarce as it is, and practically nonexistent in
thefieldofepilepsyresearch. Tobeconsideredausefulsupplementtothedatacollectedhere,
a public data set would need to provide at least ACC, EDA, and BVP data recorded from a

the whole cohort, in order to push focal seizure detection research to produce better, more
realisticallyapplicableresults[130].
Another limitation of this study, as well as many other related works, was the confine-
ment of participants to a hospital room throughout the data recording procedures. The data
collected and analyzed here cannot be regarded as representative of real-world situations,
and new ambulatory studies with a prospective goal of recording focal onset seizures with
wearables from patients in their daily living environment are needed. However, even with
generalized tonic-clonic seizures as a target, these phase 3 and 4 studies are still rare, and
potential methodologies and pitfalls need first be explored in these in-hospital studies before
worthwhileout-of-hospitalstudiescanbedesigned.
5.2.5 Conclusions
Seizure detection for focal onset seizures without generalization by means of wearable non-
EEG devices is a so far little-researched problem. This study demonstrated that for those
seizures in this category with tonic or clonic movements, that is, those closest in semiology
to generalized tonic-clonic seizures, robustly detecting seizures from wearable data may be
possible for individual patients with epilepsy, depending on their specific seizure manifesta-
tion. Overall, electrodermal activity signals seem to provide the most informative features
for seizure detection, suggesting it to be an essential part of any future seizure detection re-
search. Detection across patients with purely inter-subject models without personalization
was, however, not possible to a worthwhile degree, at least with the methodology and data
set presented here. Both a low sensitivity that misses a quarter or more of the seizures and
highfalsealarmratesintheorderofoneperhourmakecurrentresultsoftheseinter-subject
models ineffective for clinical applications. This study’s results thus demonstrated that indi-
vidualized models are needed to robustly detect focal onset seizures, and future research in

This chapter explored and evaluated the automatic detection of focal motor seizures by way
of multimodal biosignal data from wearables. Focal seizures (FSs) are the most predominant
seizuretypeinthegeneralpopulationandcanhaveamultitudeofdifferentsymptoms,rang-
ing from movement of the limbs over tachycardia to sensory feelings. However, FSs are also
typically less convulsive than their generalized-onset siblings, with some seizure types not
includingmovementsemiologyatall. Thus,theyareconsideredtobelessunambiguouslyde-
tectable with signals from wearable sensors like accelerometry (ACC), electrodermal activity
(EDA), or blood volume pulse (BVP). Still, some types of FSs exhibit characteristic patterns
both in movement and response of the autonomous nervous system, so a robust detection is
notnecessarilyimpossible.
In an exploratory investigation of focal motor seizures, the first part of this chapter high-
lighted their extreme heterogeneity in terms of semiology relevant to seizure detection with
datafromwearables. Focalmotorseizurescanmanifestincharacteristictonicorclonicmove-
ments of the limbs as much as in random automatisms of the mouth or in exceedingly brief
jerks of the whole body, oftentimes indistinguishable in the ACC signal from other non-
epileptic movements. The study illustrates a core problem of seizure detection, the high vari-
anceinfocalseizuremanifestations,byevaluatingadetectionmodelonFSsfromthreediffer-
entpatients. Whileitperformsacceptableonseizureswithcharacteristicmovementpatterns
of the limbs, it fails on other movements and those not manifesting in the limbs. This ex-
ploratory study represents a first glimpse into the conclusion of the subsequent part of the
chapter,andpartsoftheeventualconclusionofthisthesis.
That conclusion results from the final data analysis study in the context of this thesis,
namely, that robustly detecting focal onset motor seizures with tonic or clonic movements
from wearable data may be possible for individuals, depending on specific seizure manifes-
tations. Based on the experiences of the previous studies, this study includes 20 focal motor
seizures from 9 patients and evaluates both a patient-individual and a patient-agnostic ap-
proach. The detection methodology was similar to the one used in the convulsive seizure
detection in Section 4.1, but with a new set of ACC, EDA, and BVP features. It achieved
sensitivities of 67% to 100% and false alarm rates of down to 0.85/24h for individualized
detection models in three patients. Across patients, it reaches comparable sensitivity, how-
ever, false alarm rates are much higher, to the point of being impracticable for useful seizure
detectionsystems.
Viewing both parts of this chapter in the context of automatic seizure alerts, it becomes
clear that this problem is still to be solved, as multiple false alerts per day up to and beyond
one per hour are unrealistic to be accepted by users. Furthermore, other related research
reports similar performances across different combinations of focal seizure types, detection
strategies,andbiosignalmodalities. Viewingthisresearchinthecontextofautomatedseizure
diaries, however, may be more interesting for the time being. For that purpose exceptional
performance may not be the deciding factor, since the discovery of qualitative changes in
seizurefrequenciescanalreadybeanimportantoutcomeforclinicianstobeabletohelptheir
patients. And as long as the detection model can reliably detect even just a portion of the
occurringseizures,arobustqualitativeassessmentmaybewithinreach.6

W
earable devices are a relatively new and promising tool to enable the remote, unob-
trusive, and automated detection of epileptic seizures with multimodal non-electroen-
cephalography (EEG) biosignal data. Affecting over 70 million people worldwide, with up to
100 new cases per 100,000 people per year [14], epilepsy is one of the most prevalent chronic
neurologicaldisorders. Theseverityofepilepticseizurescanvarytremendously,rangingfrom
major convulsive seizures accompanied by unconsciousness and a heightened risk of sudden
unexpecteddeathinepilepsy(SUDEP),tominorsecond-longjerksorashortsensoryaura. Yet,

amount and severity of seizures. This thesis investigated the utility of wearable devices for
the ultra-long-term monitoring of patients with epilepsy, potentially improving their quality

Wearable devices like smartwatches or activity trackers will often record a variety of
biosignalsthatarerelevanttothehealthandsafetyoftheirusers. Amongthepotentialmodal-
itiesrecordedaremovementbyaccelerometry(ACC),changesintheautonomicnervoussys-
tem by electrodermal activity (EDA), and the heart rate by photoplethysmography measure-
ments. Itisconceivablethatepilepticseizures,especiallymajorconvulsiveseizuresandthose
with other motor manifestations of the limbs, can be detected automatically via changes in
these signals. Indeed, there has been more and more research into this capability in the past
ten years, making great strides towards autonomous, ambulatory, and abiding seizure detec-
tionwithwearabledevices. Nevertheless,thisisstillarelativelyyoungfieldofstudy,andthe
amount of research that has gone into designing and evaluating different methodologies of
wearable seizure detection is still in need of augmentation. This thesis compiled and framed
several contributions of the author concerning the detection of epileptic motor seizures with
multimodalnon-EEGdatafromwearables.127
Overall, the research topics presented in this thesis can be summarized to several key
contributions,expressedalongtheinvestigationsofChapters3–5:
DataCollectionWithWearables: Asafoundationforthesubsequentdataanalysisstudies,
anextensivedatasetofbiosignaldatafromwearablesneededtobecollectedinacohort
of patients with epilepsy. An open data set of such data containing recorded epileptic
seizures did not exist, so a total of 243 participants at two European epilepsy centers
were recruited during their routine stay in an EMU. More than 300 seizures of various
types were recorded with a wrist-worn research-grade wearable device (Empatica E4),
including expert-labelled seizure onset and offset as well as other relevant metadata.
Contributionsincludethedisseminationofstudydesignandprocedureexperiences,the
implementation and setup of a local data collection architecture by way of an open-
sourcemobilehealthplatform1,andtheresolutionofseveraldataissuesliketimestamp
synchronization.
DetectionofConvulsiveSeizures: A novel methodology employing features from ACC
and EDA biosignals with an ensemble supervised machine learning model was devel-
oped for the automated detection of convulsive tonic-clonic seizures (TCSs). The tech-
niquecouldcorrectlyclassify91%oftheseizureeventsinanout-of-sampletestsetof11
seizuresfrom2participantsindifferentcohorts. Further,afalsealarmrateof0.19/24h
in 78 days of data places the methodology at the same or better level than other TCS
detectionmethodologiesemployingmultimodalnon-EEGwearables. Inadifferentanal-
ysis,aheuristicACC-baseddetectorofcessationofmovementafterconvulsiveseizures
was developed. It was able to correctly classify 100% of the 22 post-ictal events in 18
studyparticipants,includingtwocasesthatshowedpost-ictalagitation,theoppositeof
thepost-ictalimmobilitythatistypicallyexperiencedafteraTCS.Bothworkscouldbe
combined into a warning system for increased risk of SUDEP, but further optimization
concerning the seizure detection latency is necessary. Still, by themselves the contri-
butions show that monitoring convulsive epileptic seizures with multimodal wearable
devicesisfeasiblewithhighrobustness.
DetectionofFocalSeizures: While the detection of convulsive seizures leaned on the dis-
tinctive and extreme impact those seizures have on the biosignals recorded with wear-
ables,thedetectionoffocalseizures(FSs),evenofthosewithmovementmanifestations,
is more ambiguous. Two contributions explore the variety of motor manifestations in
FSs and the impact of this circumstance on the feasibility of detection with wearable
device data. FSs can be characteristic in individual patients, but are typically not com-
parable across patients, reflected in the result of patient-specific detection models per-
formingoverallbetterthanthoseevaluatedwithinentirecohorts. Relatedworkonthis
topic is limited in number, and often needs to be dissected for results on specific FS
types, as they are considered in combination with convulsive seizures more often than
not. Yet, the contributions presented here show that there is substantial need for the
automateddetectionofFSsfromwearables,andcurrentresearchshowsamplepromise
thatthisiswithinreach.

cludingmovementsofthelimbswereinvestigated,anddetectionsystemsbasedonsupervised

The remaining sections of this final chapter will compile some additional lessons learned
from the experiences made during the work on this thesis, and give an outlook on several
aspectsandissuestobetackledinthefieldofseizuredetectionwithwearabledevices.
6.1 Practical Lessons Learned
During the course of working on this thesis several worthwhile experiences were made with
regard to epilepsy and wearable research. This section aims to impart some valuable lessons
learnedfromthoseexperiencesthathavenotbeenspecificallydiscussedelsewhereinthetext.
They may guide the design of new clinical studies and further research, as also discussed in
Section 6.2. This meta-analysis does not communicate systematical, scientific research that
hasbeenpublished,butreflectstheviewsandopinionsoftheauthorofthisthesis.
6.1.1 Diversity of Epileptic Seizures
Theextremeheterogeneityofepilepticseizures,especiallythoseoffocalonsetwithoutgener-
alization,hasbeendiscussedinthisthesisonvariousoccasions. Oneaspectthathasnotbeen
discussedfurther,however,istheclinicalclassificationofepilepticseizuresthatispresentedin
Fisher et al. [27]. While this newest practical classification of seizures has made great strides
inremovingambiguityinthenamingofseizuretypesinaclinicalcontext,thereisstillalack
ofcompatibilitywithrespecttotheclassificationfromnon-electroencephalographywearable
data. Of course, that was not the purpose of this terminology (re-)assessment, but it brings
uptheissueofwhetherasupplementarytaxonomyofseizuresbytheirphysiologicalsemiol-
ogy closer to what wearables may capture may be necessary. As it stands, the classification
used universally by published studies both in general epilepsy research and in research con-
cerningwearablesystemsispredominantlyfocusedontheelectrographicalonsetofaseizure
andtheperi-ictalawarenessofthepatient,andonlysecondarilyonthemotormanifestations.
However, there is currently no evidence that suggests a direct relationship between the psy-
chologicalstateofconsciousnessofapatientandphysiologicaldatarecordedfromwearables
like accelerometry, electrodermal activity, or blood volume pulse. Conversely, introducing a
ubiquitous and commonly applied (sub-)classification based primarily on movement and re-
sponses of the autonomic nervous system may facilitate a more effective communication of
wearable-basedseizuredetectionmethodologiesandevaluations. TheclassificationbyFisher
et al. [27] already takes a step in this direction, but it is not yet universally implemented by
currentrelatedworkinthisregard.
6.1.2 Selection of Meaningful Features
Again resulting from the high diversity of epileptic seizures, the performance of epileptic
seizure detection by wearables seems to be highly dependent on the recorded biosignal data
modalities and the choice of features computed from them. In the work included here, visual
inspectionofsignaltracesduringseizures(seeFigure4.1),experiencefromrelatedwork,and6.1. PRACTICALLESSONSLEARNED 129
some common sense were all very helpful in selecting the feature sets used in the analyses.
Furthermore, some research was conducted to investigate the value of certain biosignals and
features in a deliberate manner. Glasstetter et al. [348], for example, assessed the utility of
photoplethysmography(PPG)signalsfromwearablestodetectictaltachycardia,comparingit
to the gold standard of electrocardiography-based heart rate estimation. They conclude that
PPG-based estimation is feasible for seizures where tachycardia onsets before motor mani-
festations, but may be limited for other seizures due to motion artifacts impairing the signal.
This was successively observed in the evaluation of focal motor seizure detection presented
inthisthesisaswell(seeSection5.2). Thereiscertainlyroomforimprovementregardingthe
assessment of biosignal features, and more similar analyses are required beyond the current
research. Forexample,studiesapplyingmetaheuristicfeatureselectionanddimensionalityre-
ductionalgorithmstowearablebiosignaldatarecordedfromepilepsypatientscouldfacilitate
better performances of seizure detection. Moreover, non-feature-based approaches like deep
learning could be a viable path forward, but these typically require vastly more quantities of
datathanwouldberecordedinin-hospitalsettings.
6.1.3 Wearable Device Design
The current landscape of wearable devices for seizure detection is limited at best. By far the
most prominent in related research is the Empatica E4 device, which was also used in the
studies included in this thesis. Other devices exist and are in use [122], like the Byteflies
Sensor Dots [353] or the Nightwatch bracelet [226], but they are often still in development,
notcertifiedasamedicaldeviceintheEuropeanUnion,orlimitedtoafewspecificstudiesor
contexts. Coincidentally, the Empatica E4 is also at the end of its lifetime and being phased
out [354], to be replaced by a new wrist-worn wearable device from the same manufacturer
(“EmpaticaEmbracePlus”),whichhoweveratthetimeofwritinghasnotbeenfeaturedinany
peer-reviewedpublications.
During the data recording studies included in this thesis, the Empatica E4 exhibited sev-
eral issues related to device design that interfered with recordings. Primarily, the device had
several problems with the continuous streaming of data via Bluetooth connection. While the
maximum range of the wireless connection was just enough to include the whole hospital
room,suchthatthepatientwasabletomoveroamaroundtheroom,therewerefrequentand
unprompteddisconnectsevenifthewearablewaswellwithinrangeofthecompaniondevice.
Better,morerobustwirelesshardwareislikelyneededtomitigatethesedisconnects. Alterna-
tively,thedevicecouldimplementadatabufferthattemporarilycapturesbiosignalsinternally
whenever it loses the connection, transferring the data only if it is reestablished. Moreover,
thebatterylifeofthedevicewasanissue,especiallysincethebatteriestendedtodegradeover
time, with each new participant. However, this is a general problem in wearable devices and
not specific to this one, and new technologies and approaches are forthcoming. Lastly, the
wristband of the device was not flexible enough, both in its material and possible wrist sizes.
Materialsthataremoreadaptivetheindividual’sanatomy,likefabricsormorepliantplastics,
would facilitate better, cleaner biosignal recordings with sensors less prone to a loss of skin

Generally speaking, wearable devices in this domain need to balance a trade-off between

term recordings that are essential in epilepsy diagnosis and research, but they rarely give ac-
cesstorawbiosignaldata. Thelattergiveaccesstorawdata,areflexibleintermsoffirmware
and sensor parameters, and typically facilitate better overall data quality, but are impractical
at best in the at-home context due to battery limitations, connection issues, and design con-
cessions. Allthatistosay,thatwearabledevicedesign,fromthegroundup,shouldkeepboth
the patients and the researchers in mind, and not be exclusive to one group or mindset. Fur-
thermore, open data sets of biosignal data from wearables during epileptic seizures are still
a rarity, but necessary for the continued improvement of seizure detection systems. Device
manufacturers could look to build and share such data sets as a result of their device valida-
tions, were they not focused solely on the design of proprietary, closed algorithms. In fact,
entirelyopen-sourceambulatorydatacollectionandanalysiswithwearableswasshowntobe
feasible,andcouldprovidethefoundationoffutureadaptiveinterventionsystems[355].
6.2 Outlook
The data analysis studies included in this thesis each list some limitations that the respective
evaluations were subject to. Naturally there was also some overlap between those studies’
limitations. Some prominent aspects that were listed included the generally low numbers
of study participants and seizures included in the analyses, the “lab” conditions of the data
collection,thatis,in-hospitalrecordings,ordataqualityconsiderations. Thissectiondiscusses
someoftheseaspectsinthecontextofpotentialfurtherresearchwork.
6.2.1 Ambulatory Data Collection
Alldatarecordedforthestudiesinthisthesiswererecordedfrompatientsvisitinganepilepsy

troencephalography(EEG)electrodesattachedtotheirscalp. Thus,theyareheavilyrestricted
in terms of the movements they can or will do, impacting the nature of the biosignal data

they would regularly do so in their daily lives. Accordingly, seizure detection methodologies
mustbevalidatedinreal-worlddataatsomepoint. Groundtruthinformation,however,isdif-
ficulttorecordinultra-long-termambulatorystudies. Currentoptionsincludeat-homevideo
systems, which are often only viable during the night at the patient’s bed and thus are prob-
lematic with respect to their privacy. Furthermore, there are wearable EEG systems like caps
or single-channel behind-the-ear EEG, which are cumbersome, uncomfortable, stigmatizing,
andinaccurate,andimplantableEEGsensorsystemswhichareinvasiveandhaveahighcost.
Somefewphase4ambulatoryvalidationstudiesareongoing[109,223],butmorestudieswith
differentdevices,bettergroundtruth,andlargerpatientcohortsneedtobeconducted.
6.2.2 Assessment of Data Quality
Seizures are typically short, often as short as a few seconds, and so seizure monitoring re-
quires a high temporal resolution of the biosignal data as compared to many other clinical
applications [342]. Furthermore, data accuracy and reliability depend on the quality of the
recorded signals [173]. However, clinical epilepsy studies with wearables frequently under-
report quantitative measures of the quality of the recorded raw data. In particular, tools and6.2. OUTLOOK 131
standard metrics determining the data and signal quality of wearable signals are currently
missing. Yet,knowledgeofartifactsandtoolstoassesstheirimpactarecrucialforsubsequent
analysis and outcome reliability, and there is a need for extensive, automatic, standardized
data quality checks. Some recent studies have investigated wearable data quality in the con-
textofepilepsy[159,174],butmoreresearchisrequired. Comprehensivestand-alonestudies
arenecessarytoproperlyvalidatesignalqualitymetrics,butthisiseasiersaidthandone. Most
of the biosignals recorded with the wrist-worn wearable used in this thesis, for example, do
not have an immediately obvious direct gold standard that could be used as a ground truth.

likethepositionoftheelectrodesonthebodyorthetypeofelectrodeandmechanicalcontact.
Additionally, the blood volume pulse data could be validated only indirectly by estimating a
heartrate(HR)andcomparingittoanelectrocardiography-basedHR.
6.2.3 Detection of Non-Motor Seizures
Inthisthesisonlyseizureswithsometypeofmovementmanifestationwereconsidered. How-
ever,manyfocalseizuresdonotincludeepilepticmovements,butarelimitedtosymptomsof
theautonomicnervoussystem,impairmentofawareness,orsensoryauras. Automaticdetec-
tionofthoseeventsislikelytobemoreproblematic. Forone,theaccelerometrybiosignalwill
be meaningless and possibly even counterproductive, considering that random non-epileptic
movementsofthepatientcanstilloccurduringthosetimes. Furthermore,judgingfromthere-
sultsofthefocalmotorseizuredetection,individualizedanalysisislikelytobetheonlyworth-
whilepathway,atleastwithcurrentwearablebiosignalmodalities. Nevertheless,thedataset
recordedforthestudiespresentedhereincludedsomeindividualpatientswhohadnon-motor
seizures with characteristic semiology like, for example, one with ictal goose bumps on the
arms, which might be eligible for robust detection by EDA signals. Future studies or spe-
cific case reports on these examples may benefit the general understanding of some epileptic
seizuretypesandadvancenon-motorseizuredetectionwithwearables.
6.2.4 Other Machine Learning Approaches
In the seizure detection analysis contributed here, only supervised machine learning based
on expert-labeled ground truth data was employed. This does not mean, however, that other
approacheslikeunsupervisedorreinforcementlearningmaynotbeequally,orevenmoreso,
relevant and effective. Many epileptic seizures are extreme events compared to the everyday
life of patients, and so they can in a way be seen as outliers. Some research has already in-
vestigated this approach based on EEG signals [356–358], but it remains an open issue and
studiesbasedonwearabledataareyettobepublished.
Deeplearningisanotherapproachtomachinelearningthatwasnotspecificallyincludedin
thisthesis. Artificialneuralnetworkscanadheretoanyofthethreemainlearningparadigms,
supervised,reinforcement,orunsupervised. Supervisedneuralnetworksaretypicallytrained
with vast amounts of raw (non-feature) data, and thus would be most appropriate for ultra-
long-term data sets from ambulatory settings. Data sets like this with non-EEG data from
wearables are currently not available, but could be recorded with new devices suitable for
dailyat-homeuse,suchassmartwatches.132 CHAPTER6. CONCLUSION
Furthermore,methodologiesthattakefeedbackfrompatientsintoaccount,similartohow
reinforcementorsemi-supervisedlearningalgorithmswork,havethusfarnotbeenproposed
or investigated thoroughly. Such a system would directly involve patients in the continuing
improvement of a seizure detection model. For example, the model would be initially trained
inasupervisedmanneronin-hospitaldataofapatient,andintheambulatorysettingamobile
applicationcouldnotifythepatientofadetectedseizure. Thepatientwouldthengivefeedback
if the detection was true or false, or if a seizure was missed and when it occurred. Based on
those observations the model would then perpetually re-train itself on new data. Of course,
the validation of such a system would still require ambulatory ground truth recordings, but
currentresearchshowsthatthisiswithinreach.
Inconclusion,patient-involveddetectionmethodologiesthatindividualizeovertimehave
the potential to eventually become the best option for ultra-long-term seizure detection. Fu-
tureimprovementsofbiosignalsensors,batteries,andthedesignofwearabledeviceswillsub-
stantially advance the possibilities of a generic, ambulatory seizure detection system. Such a
systemcouldleverageultra-long-termdataandpersonalseizurelogsaswellasexpert-labeled
seizureepisodesfromin-hospitalrecordingstoprovideanautomatedseizurediaryandalarm.
And ultimately, this could even develop into a universal personal assistant that is tailored
towardsaspecificpatient’swantsandneeds.List of Figures
