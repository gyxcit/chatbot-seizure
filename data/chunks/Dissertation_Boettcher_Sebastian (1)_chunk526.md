for this study. Furthermore, the data set was filtered for total length of recording per partic-
ipant, where only those recordings with at least 24h of data were included, and for length
of seizures, where only those seizures with a duration between 10s and 10min are included.
Limiting the duration of seizures excludes very short seizures of just a few seconds, such as
myoclonic seizures, and very long seizures, such as status epilepticus. This is performed to
