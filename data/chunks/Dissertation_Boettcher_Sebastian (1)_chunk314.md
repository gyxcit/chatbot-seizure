patients with epilepsy in terms of incidence and prevalence, are among the most dan-
gerous, and also widely known, seizures that can occur. With regard to automatic seizure
detectionwithwearables,earlywarning,alarm,andautomateddiarysystemsareallrelevant
in some way. This thesis, however, focuses primarily on the context of seizure diaries. Both
