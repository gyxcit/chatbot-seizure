vEEG systems suffer from an occasional minor desynchronization of the EEG and video. The
data streams can then be synchronized retrospectively by adjusting the wearable data times-
tamps to align the events with the vEEG. Although the data streams can be synchronized to

Both methods are susceptible to the internal drift of timekeeping in the wearable, caused
