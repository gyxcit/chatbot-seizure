the duration of post-ictal ACC silence and seizure duration, duration of the clonic phase, and
duration of the tonic phase. The EDA signal was available for 16 of 20 seizures, whereas in 4
seizures the signal was either not recorded or corrupted. A post-ictal EDA response was ob-
served in 13 of 16 seizures (Figure 4.8c+d). The duration and amplitude of the EDA response
