Researchers are harnessing machine learning algorithms and wearable devices to forecast seizures, aiming
to elevate patient safety and quality of life [15,20-23]. These innovations entail the development of
algorithms and wearable devices that analyze a patient's brain wave data in real-time to predict seizures,
empowering individuals with epilepsy to take proactive measures such as finding a safe environment or
administering medication to forestall an imminent seizure [20]. Machine learning models are being
employed to enhance the precision of seizure prediction and diminish false alarms, which holds particular
