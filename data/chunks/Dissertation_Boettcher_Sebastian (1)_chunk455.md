Recently, some studies have also expanded to multimodal detection of FSs. Cogan et al.
[227]proposeamultistageddetectionsystemthatusesheartrate,arterialoxygenation,ACC,
EDA and temperature data, detecting 100% of FSs in the sensor readings from nearly all 10
patients their data set consists of. However, they do not specify further what type of FS they

use EDA and ACC data from 69 patients to detect GTCSs as well as FSs, comparing three
