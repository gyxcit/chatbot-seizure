1.4 Motivation
« Why do we need wearable devices in epilepsy? Seizure diaries derived from
seizures reported by patients and caregivers are unreliable, yet they constitute
the input for therapeutic decisions in clinical practice and for the outcomes in
drug trials. An objective quantification of seizure burden could improve clinical
decision-makingandthequalityofthedrugtrials.»
—SándorBeniczkyetal.,2020[99]
Broadly, the goals and use cases of automatic seizure detection are twofold: Providing
an alarm system or generating a seizure diary. In this thesis, the feasibility of automatically
generating a seizure diary by way of seizure detection with wearable data is investigated.
