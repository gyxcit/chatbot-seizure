models for epileptic seizures with movement manifestations. Electrodermal activity sensors
record electrical properties of the skin that can change during seizures, but are dependent on
dryelectrodesandskincontact. Photoplethysmographysignalscanbeusedtoestimateheart
rate (HR) and other cardiac features, but the sensors are very susceptible to motion artifacts.
Other biosignal modalities exist and are recorded by a number of different sensors, but these
arenotrelevanttothecontentofthisthesis.
Seizure detection can be monomodal or multimodal, that is, using one or more biosig-
nal modality, but a general preference is not obvious from current literature and depends on
