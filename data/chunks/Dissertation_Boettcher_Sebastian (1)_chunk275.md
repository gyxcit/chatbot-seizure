expected negative instances. To report measures like specificity based on negative instances
in the context of wearable seizure detection, the data stream must be segmented into equal-
sized portions of either the seizure or non-seizure class. Due to the large data imbalance of
these two classes that is usually observed in epilepsy studies, with sometimes multiple days
of non-seizure portions in the data interrupted only by often minute-long seizure portions,
the specificity measure is artificially boosted to consistently report values of, for example,
