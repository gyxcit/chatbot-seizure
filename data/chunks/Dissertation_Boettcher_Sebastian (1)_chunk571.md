collected and analyzed here cannot be regarded as representative of real-world situations,
and new ambulatory studies with a prospective goal of recording focal onset seizures with
wearables from patients in their daily living environment are needed. However, even with
generalized tonic-clonic seizures as a target, these phase 3 and 4 studies are still rare, and
potential methodologies and pitfalls need first be explored in these in-hospital studies before
