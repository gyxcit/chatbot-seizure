To uphold strict confidentiality during the data collection process,
stringent measures were implemented, encompassing the removal
of personal identifiers to ensure anonymity. Subsequent to the beta
trial period, the opportunity to contribute data to the database was
extendedtoallOSDuserswhoconsentedtothedatasafetystatement.
Notably, data collection remains ongoing to the present day.
For the beta trial, individuals with partial-onset epilepsy, partic-
ularly those susceptible to absence or complex focal seizures, were
intentionallyexcludedduringtheinitialphaseofdatacollection.This
decision was predicated on the absence of tonic, atonic, myoclonic,

A. PreprocessingandDataEngineering
By utilising the OSTK WebApi connector, data was extracted
as a JSON string and subsequently transformed by flattening the
hierarchical structure of the data’s nested objects and loaded as
a dataframe for manipulation. Data cleaning, analysis, and feature
engineering were conducted to prepare the data for classification.
To address the issue of imbalanced data, random oversampling was
applied to the minority class. In order to mitigate the effects of
data duplication resulting from oversampling, Gaussian noise was
introducedtotheACMdataasaformofdataaugmentation,thereby
enhancing the variability among samples. Fig.9: A visual representation of accuracy and validation accuracy
