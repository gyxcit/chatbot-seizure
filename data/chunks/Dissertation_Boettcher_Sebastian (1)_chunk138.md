nervous system activity [135]. Cardiovascular activity during seizures can be measured by
PPG sensors [136]. Finally, while not specifically used in the analyses presented here, other
relevant biosignals include the skin temperature (TMP) [137] and electrographic modalities
likeelectromyography(EMG).
