introduction:
In the world of AI-enabled seizure detection, there are two main branches:
electroencephalogram detection and non-electroencephalogram detection.
Choosing a non-EEG approach for seizure detection using machine learning (ML), deep
learning (DL), and AI has several advantages over traditional EEG-based methods. Here’s
why:
1. Human Factors (User-Centric Reasons)
A. Comfort & Usability
● EEG requires electrode placement on the scalp, which is uncomfortable and
not practical for daily use.
● Non-EEG methods (e.g., smartwatches, sensors) are wearable, lightweight,
and non-intrusive.
B. Social Acceptance & Privacy
● Wearing an EEG cap in public can cause social stigma and discomfort.
