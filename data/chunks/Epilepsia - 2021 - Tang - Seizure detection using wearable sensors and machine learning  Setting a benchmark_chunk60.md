advanced deep learning architectures and data preprocessing in wearable device signals. Although the patients were ad-
schemes individually for each data modality and integrating mitted to the hospital, they were free to move around and per-
additional clinical features. We expect that this will allow us form certain activities such as playing video games, drawing,
to leverage clinical and data modality-r elated features, thus pedaling, and watching TV as feasible in this setting. Longer
further improving detection performance and cross- patient recordings over several days may help account for daily pat-
