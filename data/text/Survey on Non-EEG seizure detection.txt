what is a seizure:
A seizure is a temporary event characterized by signs and symptoms resulting from
abnormally excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.
Types of Seizures
Seizures are classified based on where they originate in the brain and their characteristics:
Generalized Seizures:
1.
● Involve both hemispheres of the brain.
● Types include:
● Tonic-Clonic: Previously known as Grand Mal, involves muscle
contraction followed by limb extension and shaking.
● Tonic: Sustained muscle contraction.
● Clonic: Shaking movements.
● Myoclonic: Muscle spasms.
● Absence: Brief loss of awareness, previously known as Petit Mal.
● Atonic: Loss of muscle activity
Focal Seizures:
2.
● Originate in one hemisphere.
● Can be:
● Focal Aware: Previously known as simple partial, with retained
awareness.
● Focal Impaired Awareness: Previously known as complex partial,
with loss of awareness.
● Can involve motor symptoms (movement) or non-motor symptoms (sensory
changes).
Focal to Bilateral Seizures:
3.
● Start in one hemisphere and spread to both.
Who Gets Seizures?
Seizures can affect anyone, but certain conditions increase the risk:
● Vascular Causes: Stroke, hypertension.
● Infections: Meningitis, encephalitis.
● Toxins: Drugs, alcohol, medication overdoses.
● Structural Abnormalities: Arteriovenous malformations, tumors.
● Metabolic Causes: Hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances.● Autoimmune Conditions: Vasculitis.
● Idiopathic: Unknown cause.
● Stress: Can trigger seizures in epileptic patients.
Other Important Information
● Status Epilepticus: A seizure lasting over 5 minutes, requiring emergency
treatment.
● Post-Ictal Phase: Period after a seizure characterized by confusion, tiredness,
headaches, and sometimes psychosis or amnesia.
● Diagnosis: Involves witness accounts, physical exams, blood tests, and imaging
(CT/MRI). Electroencephalograms (EEGs) may also be used.
● Management: Involves removing hazards, placing the individual in the recovery
position, and administering medications like benzodiazepines. Follow-up care may
include anti-seizure medication.
