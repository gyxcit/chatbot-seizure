use EDA and ACC data from 69 patients to detect GTCSs as well as FSs, comparing three
different classification methods. Their best performing method reaches a sensitivity of 95%,
with a FAR of 0.2/24h and an F-score of 0.67 in cross-validation. However, their data set of

omodal and multimodal seizure detection on large data sets, however, these are often very
generalized in what seizure types are included. The distinction between GTCSs and FSs is
often made, but subtypes within FSs are rarely investigated or separated in the annotation.
