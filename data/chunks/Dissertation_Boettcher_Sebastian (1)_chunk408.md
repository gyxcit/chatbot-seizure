and performing equally in both the wrist and upper arm-worn devices. Figure 4.7 illustrates
an example of the post-ictal ACC silence detected by the algorithm and its correspondence
with PI labeled by experts, and an example of post-ictal agitation. Figure 4.8 illustrates the
ACC signals captured during the same seizure by the two different devices and the similar
performance of the algorithm on the two different body sites. Occasionally, the post-ictal
ACC silence lasted beyond the PI labeled by experts, as very subtle movements of the hands4.2. POTENTIALUSEOFTONIC-CLONICSEIZUREDETECTION 85
