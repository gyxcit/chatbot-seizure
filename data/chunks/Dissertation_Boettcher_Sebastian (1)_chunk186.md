Vandecasteele et al. [191] use recordings from behind-the-ear EEG electrodes in a semi-
automated FS detection. First, they had an expert rater visually annotate seizures in the data,
and then used these labels to train a SVM detection model. In a patient-specific evaluation

while these results seem low, they are still better than patient self-reports for these types of
seizures.
Due to their typically short duration of just a few seconds and low movement profile of
