Some wearables can record thermal activity by measuring the skin temperature (TMP) of the
userâ€™s body. Note that this does not capture the core temperature, so measured values are
often lower than those commonly known for human core body temperature, for example,
when determining fever, and are more prone to environmental influences [182]. Thus, TMP
reflects a combination of the ambient and skin temperature at the recording location [183].
TMP signals are prone to sudden modulation as the environment changes, for example, due
