Wearable devices serve multiple functions in monitoring and managing epilepsy, leveraging various
physiological signals for comprehensive assessment and intervention. These devices employ sensors to
capture physiological signals such as accelerometry, electrodermal activity, photoplethysmography, and
EEG, yielding high-quality data suitable for routine monitoring [11]. Innovations in wearable technology
extend to extracerebral signal monitoring, exemplified by devices like in-ear EEG devices and ambulatory
EEG systems, which offer non-invasive monitoring alternatives [14]. Such advancements broaden the scope
