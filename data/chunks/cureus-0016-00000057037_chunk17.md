Sensors and algorithms for accurate detection: Wearable devices designed for seizure detection are
significant advancements in managing epilepsy. A recent study evaluated the effectiveness of machine
learning algorithms in conjunction with wearable sensors, such as body temperature, electrodermal activity,
accelerometry, and photoplethysmography, in identifying seizures. Findings revealed that these algorithms
could detect a wide range of seizure types more accurately than chance, offering a non-stigmatizing tool to
enhance patients' overall quality of life and health outcomes [15]. These wearable digital health technologies
