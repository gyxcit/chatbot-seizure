ofepilepticseizures.
To explore the feasibility of automated seizure diaries, biosignal data from wearable de-
vices were collected from patients with epilepsy and several evaluations of methodologies
were done in the context of this thesis. The relevant data collection studies and investiga-
tions were conducted within the scope of the European Union collaborative research project
Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse - Central Nervous System 1. Within this major un-
dertaking, numerous research groups developed new ways of monitoring major depressive
disorder,multiplesclerosis,andepilepsywiththehelpofwearabledevices.
