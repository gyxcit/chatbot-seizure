smartwatches, and assorted sensors, can seamlessly transmit data such as heart rate, activity levels, sleep
patterns, and more directly to EHR systems, enriching the quantity and quality of data available to
healthcare providers [32]. In essence, the fusion of wearable technology with EHR systems promotes
interoperability, streamlines data collection processes, and augments patient care through remote
monitoring and telemedicine initiatives [30-32]. As the wearable technology market burgeons, with an
anticipated value of $60.48 billion by 2027, integration with EHR software assumes heightened significance
in delivering quality care and augmenting patient outcomes [30-32].
