three examples. The features calculated from the EDA signal, however, seem to be the most
informative with respect to epileptic seizure phases, within this data set of focal onset motor
seizures. This is concurrent with some prior research on generalized seizures as well [223,

of epileptic seizures beyond highly convulsive episodes, which usually induce heavy sweat-
