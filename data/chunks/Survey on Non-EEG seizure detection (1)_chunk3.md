C. Multimodal Sensor Fusion
● AI can combine multiple non-EEG signals (e.g., heart rate, skin
conductance, movement) to improve accuracy.
● More comprehensive seizure detection compared to EEG alone.
D. AI & Deep Learning Efficiency
● Deep learning can analyze real-time biosignals from non-EEG sources with
high accuracy.
● Machine learning models improve over time with personalized detection for
each patient.
E. Remote Monitoring & Telemedicine
● Cloud-based AI models allow real-time seizure detection and alerts for
caregivers and doctors.
● Supports telehealth applications, reducing hospital dependency.
