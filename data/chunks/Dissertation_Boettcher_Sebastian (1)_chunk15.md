toring units, and over 300 epileptic seizures of varying types were recorded with a wearable
device. Here, the Empatica E4 is used, a research-grade wrist-worn wearable that captures
the biosignal modalities of accelerometry (movement), electrodermal activity (electrical skin
conductance), and blood volume pulse (optical pulse measurement via photoplethysmogra-
