calculated values representing different aspects and properties of the raw data. These
features are most often calculated from sections of data instead of single samples, and

a certain defined length and interval, both counted in number of samples, which can
potentially result in overlap. The types of features themselves are highly dependent on
the modality of the data and the purpose of the data analysis. Features are typically
