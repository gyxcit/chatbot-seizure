thermore, open data sets of biosignal data from wearables during epileptic seizures are still
a rarity, but necessary for the continued improvement of seizure detection systems. Device
manufacturers could look to build and share such data sets as a result of their device valida-
tions, were they not focused solely on the design of proprietary, closed algorithms. In fact,
