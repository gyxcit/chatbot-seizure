providing a promising solution for enhanced patient care. Wearable technology plays a vital role in seizure
detection and monitoring. Devices like smartwatches are programmed to respond to repetitive shaking
movements indicative of seizure activity by alerting caregivers or loved ones for prompt assistance [18].
While these devices offer advantages such as recognizing specific seizure activities characterized by
significant movements, they may have limitations in detecting all seizure types and can be costly for specific
individuals. Research has demonstrated that leveraging wearable sensors and machine learning algorithms
