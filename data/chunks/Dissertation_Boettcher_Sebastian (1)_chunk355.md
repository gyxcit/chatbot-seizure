The GBT model with the optimal parameters and trained with all 10 seizures from the
training set could detect 10 of the 11 seizures in this test set (sensitivity = 91%), without any
FPs. However, this test set was limited in that it was biased towards participants who had
convulsive seizures. Therefore, the test set was expanded to also include data from all 30
patients with epilepsy recruited at the London site that had data recorded with the wearable
device. Although this does not add more seizures to the test set for the model to detect, it
