Accuracy and Reliability of Wearable Devices
Wearable devices offer a promising avenue for monitoring various health metrics, but their accuracy and
reliability can vary across different parameters. In laboratory-based settings, these devices have
demonstrated good accuracy in measuring heart rate, typically within Â±3% on average [33]. Certain brands,
such as Apple Watch, Fitbit, and Garmin, tend to perform well in heart rate measurement, although
differences in accuracy may exist between device brands [33,34]. Regarding step count measurement,
