Viewing both parts of this chapter in the context of automatic seizure alerts, it becomes
clear that this problem is still to be solved, as multiple false alerts per day up to and beyond
one per hour are unrealistic to be accepted by users. Furthermore, other related research
reports similar performances across different combinations of focal seizure types, detection
strategies,andbiosignalmodalities. Viewingthisresearchinthecontextofautomatedseizure
diaries, however, may be more interesting for the time being. For that purpose exceptional
performance may not be the deciding factor, since the discovery of qualitative changes in
