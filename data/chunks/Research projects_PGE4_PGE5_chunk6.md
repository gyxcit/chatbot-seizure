Project title Small language models for medical image analysis
Supervisor: Anuradha Kar
Brief description: This project explores the application of compact and efficient
language models to medical image analysis, addressing the growing need for
resource-effective AI solutions in healthcare. While large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated exceptional performance in interpreting medical data, their computational
requirements often limit deployment in clinical environments. Small language models
(SLMs), with fewer parameters and lower resource demands, offer a promising
alternative for real-time, scalable, and interpretable medical applications.
