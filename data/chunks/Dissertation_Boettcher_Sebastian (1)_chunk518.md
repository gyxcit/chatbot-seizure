intra-subject LOSO evaluation, resulting in one set of scores per participant included there.
Moreover, for the inter-subject LOPO evaluation, only the importance scores of the optimal
model,trainedonallseizuresfromthoseintra-subjectevaluationparticipants,werenoted. The
feature importance was based on decision tree node impurity, using the Gini diversity index
and calculated such that the smallest possible value was 0 [311, 350]. Thereby, the reported
importance scores for each of the features are the averages over all the trained trees in the
