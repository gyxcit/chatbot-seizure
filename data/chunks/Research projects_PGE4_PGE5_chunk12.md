Project Title: Enhanced X-ray Image Diagnostics with state of the art computer vision
models
Supervisor: Doreid Ammar, Anuradha Kar
Brief description: This project explores the application of advanced deep learning
techniques in analyzing X-ray images for improved medical diagnosis. The goal is to
develop and optimize deep learning models that can automatically detect and classify
abnormalities in X-ray images, aiding radiologists in making more accurate and efficient
diagnoses.
