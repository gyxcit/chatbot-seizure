Limitations
The main limitation of the study and analysis presented here is the limited size of the data
set, with just 20 seizures recorded from nine patients with epilepsy. Unfortunately, publicly
available data sets focusing on classical wrist-worn wearable data which combine movement
and autonomous nervous system biosignals are scarce as it is, and practically nonexistent in
