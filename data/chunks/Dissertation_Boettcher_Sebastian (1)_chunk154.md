volume in tissue. Thus, green LEDs are generally considered a better alternative to red ones
for PPG sensors, which has been confirmed in comparative studies [166, 167]. Additionally,
PPG sensors can measure changes in blood oxygen saturation by combining green, red, and
infraredlight[160,168,169].
The shape of a clean PPG signal is closely related to the blood pulse wave of the human
body and can vary depending on the specific measurement site [170]. Generally, a heartbeat
is visible through the signalâ€™s rising edge, culminating in the systolic peak, followed by a
