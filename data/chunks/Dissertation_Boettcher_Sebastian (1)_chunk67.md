Resective epilepsy surgery is only relevant for patients who are AED-refractory, that is,
who are not responding to AEDs, and for whom clinicians were able to define a focal seizure
onset zone. The aim of the surgery is to potentially reduce or eliminate the recurrence of
seizures [62]. During surgery, brain tissue is removed at the location of typical seizure onset
while carefully weighing a positive outcome for the patient against minimizing the risk of
furtherneurologicaldamage. Onaverage,between25%and50%ofpatientswhounderwent
