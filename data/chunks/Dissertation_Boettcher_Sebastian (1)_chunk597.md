Again resulting from the high diversity of epileptic seizures, the performance of epileptic
seizure detection by wearables seems to be highly dependent on the recorded biosignal data
modalities and the choice of features computed from them. In the work included here, visual

some common sense were all very helpful in selecting the feature sets used in the analyses.
Furthermore, some research was conducted to investigate the value of certain biosignals and
features in a deliberate manner. Glasstetter et al. [348], for example, assessed the utility of
