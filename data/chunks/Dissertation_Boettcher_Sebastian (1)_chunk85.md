whether data samples are concurrent with a seizure or not. This data labeling is often
gained from a gold standard knowledge source, for example, marked by epilepsy clini-
cians reviewing the video-electroencephalography data recorded at the epilepsy moni-
toringunit. Thelabeleddataareusedto“train”themachinelearningmodel. Thegeneral
goal is to be able to use this trained model to automatically derive labels for new, unla-
beleddata[77].
UnsupervisedLearning: Data are not labeled by some external mechanism, such that ma-
chine learning methodologies are tasked with automatically finding structures or pat-
terns in the data. A common type of unsupervised modeling are clustering algorithms,
