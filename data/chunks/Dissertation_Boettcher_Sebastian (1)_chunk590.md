DetectionofFocalSeizures: While the detection of convulsive seizures leaned on the dis-
tinctive and extreme impact those seizures have on the biosignals recorded with wear-
ables,thedetectionoffocalseizures(FSs),evenofthosewithmovementmanifestations,
is more ambiguous. Two contributions explore the variety of motor manifestations in
FSs and the impact of this circumstance on the feasibility of detection with wearable
device data. FSs can be characteristic in individual patients, but are typically not com-
parable across patients, reflected in the result of patient-specific detection models per-
