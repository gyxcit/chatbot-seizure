Machine learning is a field of research concerned with designing methodologies and algo-
rithms capable of inferring specific information from unspecific data. The constructs imple-

data sample is given a specific description in relation to the problem at hand. For ex-
ample, in seizure detection the simplest categorization would be a binary labeling of
whether data samples are concurrent with a seizure or not. This data labeling is often
