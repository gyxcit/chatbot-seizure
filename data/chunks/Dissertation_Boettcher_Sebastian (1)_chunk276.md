the specificity measure is artificially boosted to consistently report values of, for example,
>98%, even if there are many false positives (FPs). Because of this lack of informative value,

FAR reports the number of false detections over a certain timespan, often chosen as a day
(24h). For example, a FAR of 0.5 per 24h would mean that the system, on average, produces
