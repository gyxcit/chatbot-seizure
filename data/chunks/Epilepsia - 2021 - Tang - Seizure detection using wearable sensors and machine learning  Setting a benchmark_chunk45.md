All nine seizure types .720 .549 .744 .752 .695 .672 .705
Note: 10- fold cross-v alidation performance of detection models trained on individual modality data (Columns 1– 3) and multimodality data fusion (Columns 4– 7). In
each row the best AUR- ROC value is highlighted in bold. An AUC- ROC less than .6 is not significantly better than random guess. Although ACC and BVP performed
best for selected seizure types, in general, ACC + BVP data fusion provided the best overall AUC-R OC performance, as shown in the last row.
Abbreviations: ACC, accelerometry; AUC-R OC, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; BVP, blood volume pulse; EDA, electrodermal activity.
