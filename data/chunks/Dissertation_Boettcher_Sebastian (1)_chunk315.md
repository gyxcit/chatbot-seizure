wearablebiosignalsensors.
The first part of this chapter includes a study centered around the assessment of a con-
vulsive seizure detection methodology, employing features from accelerometry (ACC) and
electrodermal activity biosignal data and a boosting ensemble machine learning model. The
evaluation shows that the technique performs at least as good as some of the current best

The second part of the chapter examines the possibility to use wearables to detect and
