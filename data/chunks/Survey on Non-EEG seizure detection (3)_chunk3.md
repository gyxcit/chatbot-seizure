possible convulsive seizures and instantly alerts caregivers, whether they are
nearby or far away.
- Some devices utilize electrodermal activity (EDA) and photoplethysmography
(PPG) to detect changes in skin conductance and blood flow, which can
indicate a seizure. Machine learning algorithms can be applied to data from
these sensors to improve detection accuracy.
- Bed alarms and mattress devices are placed under the mattress and use
motion sensors to detect unusual movements during sleep. These devices
can alert caregivers if a seizure is detected. Some bed monitors trigger an
alert when it senses repetitive muscle spasms like that of a tonic-clonic/grand
mal seizure.
