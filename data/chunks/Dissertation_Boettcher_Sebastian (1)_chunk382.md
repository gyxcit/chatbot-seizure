Limitations
The methodology for TCS detection described here also introduces some limitations, one of

enabled the inclusion of tonic changes in the EDA signal spanning over multiple minutes
in the post-ictal phase. However, this automatically introduces an inherent detection delay,
as a real-time system would need to first collect these data before being able to extract the
