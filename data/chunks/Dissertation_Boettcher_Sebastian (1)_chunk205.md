the type of seizure event [201, 256]. Similarly, movement patterns captured by accelerome-
try (ACC) were used to distinguish between convulsive epileptic seizures, PNES, and normal
movements[142,257].
MS is a disease of the central nervous system characterized by a wide range of symp-
toms, including motor dysfunctions which can manifest as walking impairments. Therefore,
gait analysis has been a target of research, employing ACC sensors as a source of movement
data [258, 259]. In this context, wearable devices have similar advantages as in epilepsy re-
search: theyprovidecontinuousdatainalong-termambulatorysettingwhilebeingunobtru-
