and blood volume pulse (BVP) data, using different combinations of features from these sig-
nals to train convolutional neural network models. Their data set includes TCSs as well as
different types of FSs recorded from a predominantly pediatric cohort. For TCSs, they report
a sensitivity of 80% and a FAR of more than 13 per day when using the combination of ACC
and EDA features. Interestingly, the combination using features from all three modalities did
