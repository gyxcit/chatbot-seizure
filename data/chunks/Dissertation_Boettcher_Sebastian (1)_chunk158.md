in the sensor lifting from the skin, which will invariably result in some motion artifact in
the signal [174]. While some research presents methods to clean PPG signals from motion
artifacts [175–177], including some using a simultaneously recorded ACC signal [178–180],
they are only effective in removing minor short artifacts or those resulting from repetitive

2.2.4 Temperature
Some wearables can record thermal activity by measuring the skin temperature (TMP) of the
