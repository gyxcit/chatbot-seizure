and 5, 10, and 20 minutes for the EDA features. PPG signals were not analyzed in this study
because of major ictal movement artifacts resulting from the convulsive TCSs. Although ar-
tifacts in PPG data can still convey information, in that the presence of noise itself can be
information, the choice was made to omit it here in favor of focusing on the other 2 biosig-

The EDA features represented the skin conductance level (SCL), that is, tonic low-frequency
