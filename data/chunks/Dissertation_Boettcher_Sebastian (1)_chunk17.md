here assessed an automatic detection methodology based on a combination of accelerometry
and electrodermal activity signals. A supervised ensemble machine learning model is trained
on expert-labeled data and evaluated on an out-of-sample test set. It performs at least on
par with state-of-the-art related work, correctly classifying more than 90 percent of seizure
events with false alarm rates of less than 0.5 per day. The suggested methodology performs
