ity measures evaluate properties like the noisiness, accuracy, and potential information gain
of the data, whereas data completeness gauges data loss during recording. In the context of
exploratory research, both data quality and completeness are of utmost importance, and sev-
eral steps were taken to reflect that need. Collecting raw, unprocessed data from wearable
devices, forgoing any internal processing, can facilitate the assessment of data quality. This
