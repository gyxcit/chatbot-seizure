FIGURE 3 Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC- ROC) performance comparisons between a generalized type- agnostic
machine learning (ML) model for all seizure types and a type- specific ML model for individual seizure types. An AUC-R OC less than .6 is not
significant compared to random guess. For AUC- ROC levels greater than .6, accelerometry (ACC) performed similarly for focal to bilateral
tonic– clonic seizures (FBTCSs), focal tonic seizures, generalized tonic seizures, and generalized tonic–c lonic seizures (GTCSs); blood volume
