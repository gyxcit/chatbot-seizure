a movement. Thus, an ACC sensor moving at a constant speed will show a constant signal.
This signal includes the earth’s gravitational acceleration of ∼9.81m/s2 or 1g, which a filter
may later isolate from the linear movements in the sensor output, producing an estimate of
orientation[141]. Furthermore,ACCsensorsforhumanactivityrecognitiontypicallyemploy
