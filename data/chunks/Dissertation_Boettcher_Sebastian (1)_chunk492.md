study uses gradient boosted decision trees (GBT) as the seizure detection model. To evaluate
such an approach, and subsequently also determine the application in a real-world system,
two procedures can be applied: intra-subject or inter-subject evaluation. The intra-subject
evaluation focuses on the performance of the methodology when applied to data from a sin-
