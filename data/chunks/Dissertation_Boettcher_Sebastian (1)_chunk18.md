seizures are typically followed by a period of unconsciousness and immobility, significantly
increasing the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. A further study investigates the

Another essential segment of this thesis highlights the detection of focal seizures with
data from wearables. Focal seizures typically have very heterogeneous symptoms when re-
