mjn-SERAS
1. Description:
mjn-SERAS is a highly specialized fine technology from Epilepsyalarms in England
for seizure detection.
The mjn-SERAS monitors brain activity and uses artificial intelligence to alert users
and carers of an imminent seizure, 1-3 minutes notice before an episode occurs.
Over time, using highly sophisticated sensors that learn from the user’s brain activity,
the mjn-SERAS can predict imminent seizures even sooner. (continuous learning
model)
2. Technology
a. Configuration:
- When you first start to use the mjn-SERAS, you will need to
activate ‘training mode’. The sensors will begin to monitor the
user’s brain activity and will start to create your personalized
algorithm. During training mode, a minimum of 5 seizures must
be recorded so that the algorithm can understand how your
body, specifically your brain, responds to a seizure. Once the
AI has processed the seizure data, your device is ready to use
- Even if the alarm is false, the data is used to improve how the
AI understands your unique requirements continuously.
b. Architecture:
- mjn-SERAS uses 3 sensors to monitor brain activity which is
sent via Bluetooth to the user’s mobile phone- The mobile app indicates three risk states:
- Low risk – Minimum risk of seizure occurrence.
- Medium risk – No significant risk of seizure.
- High risk – Visual and acoustic warning signal alert.
