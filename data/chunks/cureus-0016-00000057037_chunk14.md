of monitoring options, enhancing accessibility and comfort for patients undergoing epilepsy management.
One crucial aspect of wearable technology in epilepsy management is seizure detection and differentiation,
particularly in hospitals. Wearable devices are pivotal in detecting and distinguishing seizures, facilitating
