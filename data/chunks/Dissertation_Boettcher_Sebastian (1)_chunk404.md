at a significance level of .05. When seizures were captured with both the devices (Empatica
E4 and IMEC armband), the signals collected from the wrist-worn device (Empatica E4) were
included in the analysis. Moreover, a subgroup analysis on the EDA response captured by
the wrist-worn device, producing better signals, was performed. Data were processed using84 CHAPTER4. DETECTIONOFMAJORCONVULSIVESEIZURES
