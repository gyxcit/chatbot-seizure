tectable with signals from wearable sensors like accelerometry (ACC), electrodermal activity
(EDA), or blood volume pulse (BVP). Still, some types of FSs exhibit characteristic patterns
both in movement and response of the autonomous nervous system, so a robust detection is
notnecessarilyimpossible.
In an exploratory investigation of focal motor seizures, the first part of this chapter high-
lighted their extreme heterogeneity in terms of semiology relevant to seizure detection with
