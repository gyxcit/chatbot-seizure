imaging reports, offer valuable insights but pose significant challenges due to their
complexity, variability, and sensitivity. This project focuses on benchmarking medical
language models tailored for EHRs to evaluate their performance, reliability, and
applicability in clinical settings. The benchmarking process will involve the following key
components:
1. Steps:
○ Identifying state-of-the-art MLMs, such as Med-BERT, ClinicalBERT, or
BioGPT.
○ Curating EHR datasets representative of real-world clinical environments.
○ Evaluating models based on accuracy, interpretability, efficiency, and
generalization across tasks like information extraction, clinical entity
