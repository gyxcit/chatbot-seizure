the capabilities of health monitoring devices. Wearable sensors utilize a range of physical, chemical, and
biological sensors to extract real-time physiological information, non-invasive or minimally invasive [45].
These sensors can be integrated into wearable forms such as glasses, jewelry, wristwatches, fitness bands,
and textiles, facilitating early detection and monitoring of conditions like COVID-19 and Parkinson's disease
through biophysical signals [45]. Wearable sensors encompass mechanical, electrical, optical, and chemical
modalities, each presenting unique challenges and opportunities for advancement [46]. While mechanical,
