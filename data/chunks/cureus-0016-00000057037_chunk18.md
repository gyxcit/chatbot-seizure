continuously monitor and track seizure activity, furnishing valuable data for proactive epilepsy
management. They employ various technologies, including EEG data, motion sensors, and heart rate
monitors, to detect seizures and predict the likelihood of future episodes, thus enabling early intervention
and personalized treatment plans [16]. While these devices offer benefits such as real-time alerts to patients
and caregivers, reducing the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, they do have limitations. For
instance, they may not detect all types of seizures or be affordable for everyone. It is essential to collaborate
