● Wearing an EEG cap in public can cause social stigma and discomfort.
● Wristbands, smartwatches, or even smartphone-based detection methods are
more discreet.
C. Accessibility & Cost
● EEG-based systems are expensive and require trained professionals for
setup and interpretation.
● Non-EEG devices (e.g., wearables, ECG patches) are cheaper and more
widely available.
D. Ease of Continuous Monitoring
● EEG is difficult to use for 24/7 real-life monitoring.
● Non-EEG solutions can provide continuous seizure detection at home,
improving long-term care.
E. Reduced Stress & Burden
● Non-EEG approaches reduce the emotional burden of frequent hospital
visits.
