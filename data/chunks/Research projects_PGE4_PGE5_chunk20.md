models under various conditions, including different lighting, object arrangements, and
activity scenarios. ResNet, a convolutional neural network (CNN), can be evaluated for
its ability to extract hierarchical features and classify objects and scenes. YOLO (You
Only Look Once), a real-time object detection model, will be assessed for its speed and
accuracy in detecting multiple objects and human presence in dynamic scenes.
Performance metrics such as detection accuracy, precision, recall, inference time, and
computational efficiency will be analyzed. Additionally, the modelsâ€™ ability to provide
context-aware scene descriptions by integrating object and human detection outputs will
