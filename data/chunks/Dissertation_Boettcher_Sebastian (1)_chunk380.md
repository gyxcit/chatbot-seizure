specifically during the night. Their thresholding algorithm could detect 86% of the recorded
seizures, with a positive predictive value of 49%, indicating that roughly half of all predic-
tions were FPs. Although the methodology introduced here produces slightly worse results
with respect to the overall FAR, the studies differ in that the NightWatch study only assessed

daytime seizures; notably, all the FPs were generated while the respective patient was awake
