electrical, and optical sensors have made significant strides in miniaturization and flexibility, chemical
sensing modalities encounter hurdles in commercial adoption, particularly for non-invasive applications
[46]. The future trajectory of wearable sensors lies in integrating hybrid mechanisms to comprehensively
monitor various physiological parameters [47]. This integration entails merging flexible power units with
wearable sensors to create self-powered systems capable of continuous monitoring [47]. The forefront of
wearable sensor technology delves into precision medicine and personalized healthcare, where wearable
