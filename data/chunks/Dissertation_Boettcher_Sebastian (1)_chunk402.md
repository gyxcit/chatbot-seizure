estimated as the time between start and end of the EDA response. Furthermore, the response
amplitude (EDA amplitude) was defined as the difference between the response peak and the
pre-ictalbaseline.
StatisticalAnalysis
Linear regression was used to analyze the linear pairwise relationship between the automat-
ically detected duration of post-ictal ACC silence and other variables, such as duration of PI,
