Note: Leave- one- subject- out performance of detection models trained on individual modality data (Columns 1– 3) and multimodality data fusion (Columns 4– 7). In
each row the best AUR- ROC value is highlighted in bold. An AUC- ROC less than .6 is not significantly better than random guess. Although ACC and BVP modalities
performed best for some specific seizure types, in general, ACC + BVP data fusion provided the best averaged AUC-R OC performance.
