specified to detect convulsive seizures and achieve a very good performance, with their best
classifier reaching a sensitivity of 94.5% and a FAR of 0.2 per day on 55 seizures from 22
patients. The work presented here is on par with their results and reinforces their findings.
It is shown that results of this quality can be achieved with a relatively basic methodology,
which is described in greater detail here, making it fully accessible and reproducible. The
methodology may even be transferrable to other diseases with convulsive attacks, such as
paroxysmal dystonia1 or psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Thus, the study described here
