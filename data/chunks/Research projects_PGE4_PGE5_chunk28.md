focusing on time-series analysis, deep learning models, and hybrid approaches.
Establish a standardized framework for handling epilepsy-related data, from noise
reduction to feature engineering, to improve reproducibility and accuracy in seizure
detection.
● Expected outcomes: A survey of state of the art in methods for anomaly
detection from epilepsy datasets. A data processing pipeline for epilepsy data
analysis.
● Required skills or prerequisites (if any): - Python – Scikit-Learn - Git - Bash
