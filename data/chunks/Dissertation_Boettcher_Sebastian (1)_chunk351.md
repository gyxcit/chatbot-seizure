Cross-validationTraining
The training set used for hyperparameter optimization included 10 seizures from 8 partici-
pants and covered 414.7h of wearable device data. With the best parameter combination, as
described above, the LOPO cross-validation could detect all 10 seizures (sensitivity = 100%)
with a total of 8 FPs (FAR = 0.46 per 24h). The FP rate was calculated as the ratio of total
FPs across all participants to the number of hours of recordings multiplied by 24, and not the
mean FAR across participants. In the training set LOPO cross-validation, 75% (6/8) of FPs
wereproducedfromthedataof1participantand2byanother. Thus,theother6participants
