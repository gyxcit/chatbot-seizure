that records surface EMG signals on 199 patients with epilepsy. Their thresholding method
detects 76% of overall GTCSs, with a FAR of 2.5/24h. However, they also distinguished be-

100% of GTCSs were detected with a FAR of 1.4/24h. They conclude that proper placement
of the device is important. EDA and ACC signals are used by Poh et al. [153] to detect 94%
of GTCSs in a data set from 80 patients, with a FAR of 0.7/24h. More recently, Regalia et al.
[293] also used EDA and ACC signals to detect GTCSs, attaining a sensitivity of greater than
