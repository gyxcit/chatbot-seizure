tations. Based on the experiences of the previous studies, this study includes 20 focal motor
seizures from 9 patients and evaluates both a patient-individual and a patient-agnostic ap-
proach. The detection methodology was similar to the one used in the convulsive seizure
detection in Section 4.1, but with a new set of ACC, EDA, and BVP features. It achieved
sensitivities of 67% to 100% and false alarm rates of down to 0.85/24h for individualized
detection models in three patients. Across patients, it reaches comparable sensitivity, how-
ever, false alarm rates are much higher, to the point of being impracticable for useful seizure
detectionsystems.
