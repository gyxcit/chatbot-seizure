abnormalities in X-ray images, aiding radiologists in making more accurate and efficient
diagnoses.
The project employs cutting-edge architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and Transformer-based models, to enhance image quality, segment key
features, and identify a wide range of conditions, from bone fractures and tumors to lung
diseases like pneumonia or tuberculosis. By training these models on large, annotated
X-ray datasets, the system learns to recognize patterns and anomalies that may be
missed by the human eye.
Key objectives include improving the modelâ€™s diagnostic accuracy, reducing false
