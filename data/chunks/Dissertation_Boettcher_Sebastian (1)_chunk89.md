1.3.2 Supervised Machine Learning Models
In supervised learning, algorithms trained with labeled data must generalize to previously
unseen data. This poses a trade-off between bias and variance concerning the ability of a
model to predict the correct output for some arbitrary input data. A model with a high bias,
for example, would not properly represent the structure of the data because it makes certain
incorrect assumptions about the complexity of the data, or lack thereof. It would be under-
