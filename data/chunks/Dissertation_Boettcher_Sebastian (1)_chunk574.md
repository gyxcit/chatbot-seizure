5.3 Summary
This chapter explored and evaluated the automatic detection of focal motor seizures by way
of multimodal biosignal data from wearables. Focal seizures (FSs) are the most predominant
seizuretypeinthegeneralpopulationandcanhaveamultitudeofdifferentsymptoms,rang-
ing from movement of the limbs over tachycardia to sensory feelings. However, FSs are also
typically less convulsive than their generalized-onset siblings, with some seizure types not
