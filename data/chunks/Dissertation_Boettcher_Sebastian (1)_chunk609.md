6.2.2 Assessment of Data Quality
Seizures are typically short, often as short as a few seconds, and so seizure monitoring re-
quires a high temporal resolution of the biosignal data as compared to many other clinical
applications [342]. Furthermore, data accuracy and reliability depend on the quality of the
recorded signals [173]. However, clinical epilepsy studies with wearables frequently under-
report quantitative measures of the quality of the recorded raw data. In particular, tools and6.2. OUTLOOK 131
