monly smartwatch-like devices or fitness trackers that record biosignals such as accelerom-
etry (ACC), electrodermal activity (EDA), blood pulse via photoplethysmography (PPG), and
electromyography (EMG). These biosignals have been shown to give sufficient indication to-
wards epileptic seizures, with research focusing on monomodal and multimodal detection of
generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs). GTCSs are one type of seizure that involves both
hemispheres of the brain and present themselves in violent bilateral muscle contractions of
the whole body. These are very different from focal seizures (FSs), which start in only one
