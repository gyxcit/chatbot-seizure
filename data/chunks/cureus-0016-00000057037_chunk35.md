variability in the estimates, and accuracy can differ depending on the specific device model [33]. Regarding
oxygen saturation estimation, wrist-worn activity trackers may need more accuracy for sports and
healthcare applications. Although devices like the Apple Watch and Garmin smartwatches demonstrate
better accuracy than other popular smartwatches, they have yet to undergo thorough validation [34]. For
epilepsy management, while research on the accuracy and reliability of wearable devices is limited, it is
crucial to consider the overall accuracy and reliability of these devices when evaluating their potential for
