Project title: Multimodal AI for indoor monitoring for Parkinson's disease patients
Supervisor: Anuradha Kar
Brief description : This project leverages multimodal AI to improve the quality of life
and clinical outcomes for Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients through continuous,
non-invasive indoor monitoring. Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological
disorder that impairs motor functions, balance, and speech, requiring tailored
interventions. Monitoring these patients in real-world environments can offer critical
insights into disease progression and treatment efficacy.
