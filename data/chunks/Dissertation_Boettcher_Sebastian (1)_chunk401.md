to obtain the tonic component of the raw EDA signal. The EDA baseline was computed over
the 60min pre-ictal segment. The start of the EDA response was defined as the point after
the labeled start of the seizure where the filtered EDA signal first reached a value of baseline
+2Ïƒ. The end of the response was defined as the point after the start of the response where
