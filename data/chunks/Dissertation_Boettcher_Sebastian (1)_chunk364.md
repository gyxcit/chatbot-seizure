sensitivity of 91% (10/11) on the out-of-sample test set, and a FAR of less than 1 per 5 days
in more than 1800h of data indicates a sufficient robustness of this methodology to consider
it in designing an automated seizure diary. A large percentage of FPs occurred in a small
percentage of participants, with most other participants showing between 0 and 0.5 FPs per
day. Furthermore, in participants of the test set who had TCSs, no FPs were reported by
the model. In addition, all true detections of the model occurred within the ictal period of
the respective seizure, showing that the system has high accuracy. Evaluating a test set that
