used as features. Recurrence plots are a statistical tool to analyze recurrence in time series
data [345, 346], and have been successfully used in the detection of motor movements from
accelerometer data before [104, 308, 347]. Specifically, the determinism (percentage of points
that form diagonal lines of a minimal length), the Shannon entropy (probability that a line5.2. DETECTIONOFFOCALMOTORSEIZURES 107
