of patients with epilepsy. An open data set of such data containing recorded epileptic
seizures did not exist, so a total of 243 participants at two European epilepsy centers
were recruited during their routine stay in an EMU. More than 300 seizures of various
types were recorded with a wrist-worn research-grade wearable device (Empatica E4),
including expert-labelled seizure onset and offset as well as other relevant metadata.
