Project 1
Project title: Benchmarking Medical Language Models for analysing Electronic Health
Records
Supervisor: Anuradha Kar
Brief description The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is
transforming the way medical information is processed, analyzed, and utilized. Among
the various AI applications, medical language models (MLMs) have emerged as critical
tools for understanding and interpreting electronic health records (EHRs). These
records, comprising unstructured clinical notes, laboratory results, prescriptions, and
imaging reports, offer valuable insights but pose significant challenges due to their
