Epileptic seizures are defined by a period of abnormal neuronal activity in the brain, and are
generally divided into two main groups by their neurological onset [27]. Seizures with an
early bilateral involvement are called generalized seizures, while seizures with just a single
point of onset are denoted as focal onset seizures, but epileptic activity can propagate across
the brain resulting in “focal to bilateral” seizures with characteristic motor manifestations.
Bilateral tonic-clonic seizures have been assessed in numerous studies as to the viability of
