radiology images to support veterinarians in diagnosing and managing animal health
conditions.
The project involves designing a robust preprocessing pipeline to optimize radiology
images, ensuring high-quality input for the LLM. Tasks include noise reduction,
normalization, segmentation, and feature enhancement, tailored to the unique
anatomical characteristics of different animals. The processed images are then
integrated into the LLM, which has been fine-tuned on veterinary-specific datasets, to
produce comprehensive, contextually relevant diagnostic reports.
The aim is to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability of the LLM in
