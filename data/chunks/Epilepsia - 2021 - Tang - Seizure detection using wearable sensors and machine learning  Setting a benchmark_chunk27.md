depicted columnwise from left to right consists of the following modules: (1) individual sensor modalities generating raw time series data, (2)
modality fusion techniques, (3) data sampling methods to compensate for data imbalance, and (4) ML techniques adapted to raw time series. (B)
A convolutional neural network (Conv: Convolutional, ReLU: Rectified Linear Unit) is used to analyze raw time series data. ACC, accelerometry;
BVP, blood volume pulse; EDA, electrodermal activity
2.6 | Statistical methods true positive rate (also known as sensitivity) against the FAR
at various threshold settings. AUC is the area under the ROC
