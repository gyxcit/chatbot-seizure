To gauge the influence of the various features on the creation of the model, the feature
importance of each of the optimized models was analyzed. Therefore, the importance scores
for each of the models resulting from the single cross-validation runs was averaged in the
intra-subject LOSO evaluation, resulting in one set of scores per participant included there.
