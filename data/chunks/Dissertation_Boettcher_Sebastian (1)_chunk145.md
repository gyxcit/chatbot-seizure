Besides accelerometers, specialized in capturing linear translation, gyroscopy (GYR) sen-
sors can measure rotation more accurately. In many cases, these two sensors are used in
conjunction, applying sensor fusion to better estimate the device’s position and angle [145].

2.2.2 Electrodermal Activity
With increasing body or skin temperature, the sweat gland activity increases, and sweat pro-
duction changes the skin’s electric properties like its conductance, which EDA recordings
can capture [148]. Besides thermoregulatory processes, other sympathetic nervous system
