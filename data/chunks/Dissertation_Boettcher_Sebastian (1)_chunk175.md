several features from it. They do not specifically investigate a detection algorithm, but de-
scribe in detail the pre- and post-seizure periods of TCSs compared to a baseline in terms of
these extracted features. The authors do this to avoid the severe motion artifacts PPG signals
would have during the ictal phase of TCSs, which further highlights the lack of evidence of
