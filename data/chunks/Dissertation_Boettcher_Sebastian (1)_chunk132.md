more, smartphones can serve as an ad hoc solution to provide video monitoring of seizures
outside of dedicated video monitoring units [120]. Data from ambulatory epilepsy monitor-
ing with wearable devices may also contribute to advances in seizure forecasting and pre-
diction [60]. Multiple studies have investigated the feasibility of wearable non-EEG devices
for epilepsy monitoring and seizure detection out of the hospital, but assessment without an
