nal modality, but a general preference is not obvious from current literature and depends on
context. The detection of tonic-clonic seizures has the highest-performing evidence in re-
lated work, and phase 4 prospective ambulatory studies are beginning to yield results. Motor
focal seizures (FSs) can be difficult to detect, but some evidence shows that there is good po-
tential for robust wearable seizure detection systems, especially if model personalization is
implemented. Non-motor FSs are possibly the hardest to detect with wearables, relying on
physiological modalities like HR, and there is little evidence in literature so far that attempts
