seizure detection of such a system needs to be evaluated as well. While individual-based de-
tection is one possible approach, the need for generalized models is apparent, and current
state-of-the-art moves in the direction of individual-invariant models. Furthermore, a sys-
temâ€™s performance on different types of seizures like autonomic or dyscognitive FSs needs
to be evaluated. Therefore, PPG features need to be considered in addition to the ACC and
EDAfeaturesalreadyimplemented. Multi-classclassificationofseizuretypesandspecifically
recognition of phases within focal seizures are reasonable goals that may be achieved by a
