to be extended by an automatic seizure detection. The detection methodology presented in
the first part is however not entirely applicable as the detection delay caused by the choice
of features from the multimodal biosignal data makes it impracticable for this purpose. Most
essentially, the long-term feature calculation window of 5min into the future for the EDA
features introduces a delay that is likely to be longer than the seizure itself. The long EDA
