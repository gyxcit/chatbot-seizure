seizures of the three selected patients had a mean of 1min 55s. Thus, one seizure accounts
for approximately 112min of data, amounting to approximately 41h of data for all seizures
of the three selected patients. The 55min margin was chosen due to the large EDA window
sizes and characteristically long EDA response time. Typical EDA response times can last up
