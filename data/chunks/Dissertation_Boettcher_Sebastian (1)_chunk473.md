a seizure. This behavior is expected, as there often are detections right after the seizure in
data set 1, as can be seen in Figure 5.3. Especially the precision score is affected by this, as
primarily false positive classifications after a seizure are avoided. For P1 the recall score also
improves substantially with data set 2, showing that the detection of clear and characteristic

Contrarily, for P3 recall scores improve less than precision. Overall however, the seizures
