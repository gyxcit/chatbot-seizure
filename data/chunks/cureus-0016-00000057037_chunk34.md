differences in accuracy may exist between device brands [33,34]. Regarding step count measurement,
wearable devices exhibit accuracy in controlled environments, yet variations may occur depending on the
brand and device type. While brands like Apple Watch and Samsung have fewer studies compared to others,
they demonstrate consistent step count estimates within tight ranges [33]. However, when it comes to
estimating energy expenditure, wearable devices may need more accuracy. Fitbit devices are an exception, as
they tend to measure energy expenditure within acceptable limits. Nevertheless, there remains significant
