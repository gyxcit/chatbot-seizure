time systems [12]. Ethernet body-worn motion sensors have also been developed to detect motion
abnormalities in epileptic patients, providing additional monitoring capabilities and alert mechanisms [12].
Wearable digital health technology has revolutionized epilepsy management by offering continuous
monitoring, prediction systems, and innovative alarm mechanisms that improve patient safety and well-
being while providing valuable insights into seizure prediction and management [10,13].
