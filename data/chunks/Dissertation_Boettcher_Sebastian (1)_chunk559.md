their data set included only a very small number of CPS, a good performance on this seizure
type was not to be expected. Lastly, Vandecasteele et al. [74] compared two wearable devices

of 43.2 for the PPG-based wearable device, which was the same as the one used in this study.
They concluded that the PPG-based detection was heavily impeded by motion artifacts even
forthesepossiblynon-generalizedseizures.
