Medicalcertification: Wearables, in general, are employed in many different fields beyond
medicine, so for use in studies as described here, the certification as a medical device
can be an important factor. IMECâ€™s sensor bracelet for example, as a prototype device,
is not independently certified, whereas the Empatica E4 has a European CE class IIa
certificationasamedicaldevice.3.1. STUDYPROCEDURES 51
Modalities: Different devices record different biosignals at different sample rates, so an in-
formed decision needs to be made about exactly what is needed to facilitate the out-
comes of the given study. Multimodal devices are generally regarded as more effective
