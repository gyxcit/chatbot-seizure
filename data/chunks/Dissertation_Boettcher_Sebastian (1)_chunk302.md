the difference between the Empatica E4 and Android OS reference time, which was regularly
synchronized with the internal vEEG time. The estimated short-term linear segments of the
drift were then subtracted from the same, resulting in new timestamps for each sample that
are in line with the reference time, within a margin for error of less than one second. Fig-
