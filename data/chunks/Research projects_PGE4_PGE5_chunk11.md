The aim is to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability of the LLM in
analyzing radiology data, enabling it to identify subtle abnormalities and suggest
possible diagnoses. The outcome will be a streamlined diagnostic tool that provides
veterinarians with actionable insights, improving patient outcomes and advancing
animal healthcare.
By leveraging the power of AI, this project aspires to bridge gaps in veterinary
diagnostics, offering accessible and reliable solutions to enhance the health and welfare
of pets.
‚óè Expected outcomes: A framework with small language models trained for a
medical image (CT/MRI/Xray) analysis task, comparison of multiple models for
the task
