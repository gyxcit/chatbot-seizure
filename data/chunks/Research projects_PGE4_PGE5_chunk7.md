alternative for real-time, scalable, and interpretable medical applications.
The project focuses on integrating SLMs with multimodal data, particularly medical
images and accompanying textual data such as radiology reports, pathology notes, or
electronic health records. Tasks include image captioning, report generation, disease
classification, and anomaly detection. By leveraging pre-trained SLMs fine-tuned on
medical datasets, the approach ensures domain-specific accuracy while maintaining
computational efficiency.
Key objectives include evaluating the performance of SLMs against LLMs in medical
imaging tasks using benchmarks like accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and inference
