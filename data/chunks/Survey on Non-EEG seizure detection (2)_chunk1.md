user’s brain activity and will start to create your personalized
algorithm. During training mode, a minimum of 5 seizures must
be recorded so that the algorithm can understand how your
body, specifically your brain, responds to a seizure. Once the
AI has processed the seizure data, your device is ready to use
- Even if the alarm is false, the data is used to improve how the
AI understands your unique requirements continuously.
b. Architecture:
- mjn-SERAS uses 3 sensors to monitor brain activity which is
sent via Bluetooth to the user’s mobile phone- The mobile app indicates three risk states:
- Low risk – Minimum risk of seizure occurrence.
- Medium risk – No significant risk of seizure.
