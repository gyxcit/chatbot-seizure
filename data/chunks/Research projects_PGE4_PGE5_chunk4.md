insights into disease progression and treatment efficacy.
The system integrates data from one or more cameras and wearable sensors, to
provide a holistic view of the patientâ€™s condition. Advanced machine learning models
analyze multimodal inputs to track symptoms such as tremors, gait disturbances, and
freezing episodes. It also evaluates non-motor symptoms like sleep disturbances and
cognitive decline.
This project emphasizes interpretability of the used models ensuring that AI-generated
insights are transparent and actionable for healthcare providers. The system is
designed to support early intervention by identifying patterns indicative of symptom
