detected seizures over 24 h. We defined detection delay as the dian age = 9.9 years, range = 27.2, interquartile range = 9.2;
difference between the seizure onset and detector recognition 54 [57.4%] males; Table 1, Figure S3), and 548 seizures. For
of seizure activity. training purposes, we had seizure onset and offset annotations
We calculated seizurewise area under the curve (AUC)â€“ for 930 seizures captured by both left and right sensor devices.
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) value, sensitivity, The dataset is highly imbalanced, containing 153 h of ictal and
and FAR per 24 h. The ROC curve is created by plotting the 10 913 h of normal interictal brain activity signals.
