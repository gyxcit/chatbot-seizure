Epilepsy alarms and monitors
Introduction:
Epilepsy alarms and monitors are devices designed to detect seizures and alert
caregivers when a person is experiencing a seizure. There isn’t enough evidence yet to
show that using a seizure alarm or monitor can guarantee someone’s safety during a seizure
or prevent sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) that is why some people with
epilepsy have found using alarms and monitors helpful as part of a risk reduction plan.
Most seizure alarms are designed to detect tonic-clonic seizures. These seizures are easier
to detect because they involve movement.
