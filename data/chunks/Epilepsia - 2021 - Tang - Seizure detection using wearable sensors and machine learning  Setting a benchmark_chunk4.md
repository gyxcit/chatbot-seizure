epileptic seizures (11 066 h of sensor data) for a total of 930 seizures and nine seizure
types. Algorithm 1 detected eight of nine seizure types better than chance (area under
the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC-R OC] = .648–. 976). Algorithm 2
detected all nine seizure types better than chance (AUC-R OC = .642–. 995); a fusion
of ACC and BVP modalities achieved the best AUC-R OC (.752) when combining all
seizure types together.
Significance: Automatic seizure detection using ML from multimodal wearable sen-
sor data is feasible across a broad spectrum of epileptic seizures. Preliminary results
