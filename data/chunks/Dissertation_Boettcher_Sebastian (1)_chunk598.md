features in a deliberate manner. Glasstetter et al. [348], for example, assessed the utility of
photoplethysmography(PPG)signalsfromwearablestodetectictaltachycardia,comparingit
to the gold standard of electrocardiography-based heart rate estimation. They conclude that
PPG-based estimation is feasible for seizures where tachycardia onsets before motor mani-
festations, but may be limited for other seizures due to motion artifacts impairing the signal.
This was successively observed in the evaluation of focal motor seizure detection presented
inthisthesisaswell(seeSection5.2). Thereiscertainlyroomforimprovementregardingthe
