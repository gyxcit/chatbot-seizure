wards lower FARs than multimodal detection. However, this does not account for differences
in wearable sensors, study protocols, or recent developments in the state-of-the-art. Current
studies using multimodal detection with both the ACC and EDA modalities, including the
analysis included in this thesis (Section 4.1.3), have reported better results than the average

Related work concerning the detection of FSs, with or without movement components,
is even more heterogeneous. At the same time, there are also less published studies investi-
