different groups of features by modality. This calculation would result in one feature vector,
for the next the windows would all be shifted by an interval of T = 2s to the right. Abscissa

has a certain length), the average diagonal line length, and the recurrence rate (density of
recurrence points) were calculated from the recurrence quantification analysis. All of these
values are derived from overlapping data windows of a length of 10s, centered at each 2s
interval.
The EDA features used here are calculated from the skin conductance level and the skin
conductance response rate (SCRR) [42, 135, 150, 246]. The former is essentially a low-pass
