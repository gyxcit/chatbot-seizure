conductance response rate (SCRR) [42, 135, 150, 246]. The former is essentially a low-pass
filtered version of the original raw EDA signal and thus represents the slower tonic changes
in the EDA data. It is represented in the feature set by the difference of area under the curve
and maximum between the five minutes before (feature window) and after (baseline) each
two-secondintervalpoint. Additionally,theSCRRfeatureiscalculatedagainstthebaselinein

is calculated as the number of threshold crossings of the first derivative of the EDA signal in
thewindow.
