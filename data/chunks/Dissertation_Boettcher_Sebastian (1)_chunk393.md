conductance of the skin through dry electrodes. Both the devices measure the conductance
between two electrodes on the skin by applying a direct current to the stratum corneum1
beneath the electrodes. The sampling frequency for the EDA measured at the ventral side
of the wrist is 4Hz (Empatica E4) and at the ventral side of the upper arm is 256Hz (IMEC
armband). The devices were worn on the nondominant hand. Video-electroencephalography
