engineering, and integrate with advanced detection algorithms. This dual focus will
advance understanding of epilepsy-related anomalies, contribute to the development of
reliable seizure monitoring systems, and support improved patient care and timely
intervention strategies.
Project objectives:
Design a robust pipeline for managing raw physiological and motion data, ensuring
efficient preprocessing, feature extraction, and integration with machine learning
models.
Perform a detailed review of current techniques in anomaly detection for epilepsy,
focusing on time-series analysis, deep learning models, and hybrid approaches.
