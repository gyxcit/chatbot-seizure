per patient would be required to sufficiently train and optimize their algorithm parameters,
based on a worst-case scenario. Kusmakar et al. [341] employed ACC sensors in a leave-one-
participant-out inter-subject evaluation and reported a sensitivity of 67% and a FAR24 of 4,
regarding the participants with CPS. They duly concluded that these seizures are much more
similar to inter-ictal data than they are to ictal generalized tonic-clonic seizure data, and as
their data set included only a very small number of CPS, a good performance on this seizure
