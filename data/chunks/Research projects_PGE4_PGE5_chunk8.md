imaging tasks using benchmarks like accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and inference
time. The study also emphasizes interpretability, ensuring clinicians can trust and
understand model outputs.
This work aims to make advanced AI tools accessible for diverse healthcare settings,
from well-equipped hospitals to low-resource clinics, democratizing AI-driven medical
diagnostics and improving patient outcomes.
● Expected outcomes: A framework with small language models trained for a
medical image (CT/MRI/Xray) analysis task, comparison of multiple models for
the task
● Required skills or prerequisites (if any) Python, LLM, Huggingface, data
