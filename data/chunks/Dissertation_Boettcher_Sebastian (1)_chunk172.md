straightforward seizure type todetect with wearables. Accordingly, there already are numer-
ous published studies investigating these seizures with a variety of devices and methodolo-
gies, some few even rated as phase 4 studies designed prospectively and with a predefined

some studies include sensitivities of >90% and false alarm rates (FARs) of as low as 0.2 per
24h.
Monomodal detection of TCSs has been considered with almost every kind of relevant
biosignal modality that can be measured from wearables. ACC is the most obvious modality
