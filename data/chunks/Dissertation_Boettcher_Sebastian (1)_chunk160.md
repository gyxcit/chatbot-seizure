temperature can take multiple seconds or minutes and might occur delayed [184]. Therefore,
artifacts in the temperature signal can register as sudden spikes or dips, for example, as the
subject removes the wearable from the body for a short time. These could be detected by
monitoring andthresholding the rate ofamplitude change, similarto the artifacts seenin the
EDAsignal[159].
