generalization across tasks like information extraction, clinical entity
recognition, and note summarization.
○ Assessing use cases such as decision support, risk prediction, and patient
stratification.
● Expected outcomes: The project aims to identify strengths and limitations of
existing MLMs, providing guidance for their optimization and deployment in
healthcare systems. By establishing standardized benchmarks, the project will
facilitate the development of more reliable, efficient, and interpretable models
that align with the specific demands of EHRs. This research will significantly
contribute to improving clinical workflows, enabling personalized medicine, and
enhancing patient care.
