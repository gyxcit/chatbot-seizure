by leveraging predictable cyclic structures in the occurrences of seizures for some patients,
or by deep learning modeling with wearable data. As these tasks require a lot of data over
months or years, data sharing and crowdsourcing has a high priority. Non-epileptic seizures

in this regard are psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. To correctly diagnose these, epilepsy
monitoring units perform differential diagnosis. Other diseases with partially similar symp-
toms to epilepsy and where wearables are used in research are multiple sclerosis or Parkin-
