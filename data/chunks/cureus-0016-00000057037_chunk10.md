Role of Wearable Devices in Epilepsy Monitoring and Management
Wearable devices are critical in monitoring and managing epilepsy by facilitating continuous physiological
signal monitoring for seizure detection and assessing treatment response. These devices, such as wrist-worn
sensors, can measure various signals, including accelerometry, electrodermal activity,
photoplethysmography, and EEG, yielding high-quality data for routine use [10,11]. Wrist-worn devices have
gained popularity among patients due to their convenience and effectiveness in monitoring seizure activity
[11]. Advancements in wearable technology have introduced devices based on extracerebral signals, in-ear
