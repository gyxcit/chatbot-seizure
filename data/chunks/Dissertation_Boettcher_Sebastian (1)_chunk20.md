considerably worse than those specific to an individual patient, with high false alarm rates.
Thus, for focal seizure detection, custom-made detection models for individual patients are

This thesis concludes that while generic seizure detection models may be sufficient for
highly convulsive seizures and under in-hospital conditions, they are currently not feasible
