all events, showing significant correlation between the detected and the true length of the PI
period. The continuous detection of risk factors associated with seizures is of great clinical
importance,andthestudyshowsthatwearablesmaybeausefultoolforthistask.
The two studies, while at first glance are both focused specifically on convulsive TCSs,
are not immediately compatible. The identification of PI is based on prior knowledge of the
occurrence of a convulsive seizure, and so a potential SUDEP warning system would need
to be extended by an automatic seizure detection. The detection methodology presented in
