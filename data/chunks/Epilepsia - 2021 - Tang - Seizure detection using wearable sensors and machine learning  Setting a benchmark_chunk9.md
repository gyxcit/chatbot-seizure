tonic– clonic seizures (GTCSs), with wearable devices.3,8– 10 seizures
Recent advances in the use and development of non-E EG-
based seizure detection devices utilizing a variety of sensors
and modalities provided innovative opportunities to fill this
gap and to monitor patients continuously in the outpatient with wearable devices for a broad spectrum of epileptic sei-
