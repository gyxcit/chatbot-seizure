Accelerometers are generally robust against measurement artifacts. Fundamentally, any
movement large enough to cause a change in the analog capacitance could be measured, and
there are no external, physical, or other reasons for the sensor to produce a relevant change
in the signal if there was no movement, provided that it is correctly placed on the body. The
