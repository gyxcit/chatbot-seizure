designed for future action prediction. FutureGAN operates by learning spatiotemporal
dependencies in historical data to predict plausible future actions or trajectories. The
generative model is trained adversarially against a discriminator, ensuring predictions
are both realistic and contextually consistent.
Key tasks include identifying relevant datasets for training and testing, such as activity
recognition or trajectory datasets, and evaluating model performance using metrics like
prediction accuracy, F1-score, and temporal coherence. The benchmarking study will
compare FutureGANâ€™s performance to other models, analyzing its advantages in terms
