Figure 3.5: Example of the timestamp drift correction for multi-day E4 data. Shown are the
increasing drift of native E4 time vs. the Android OS reference time (blue); The estimated

and the reference time (red). The visible reoccurring small changes in drift originate in the
reference time and are not present in the native E4 or corrected time. Points in time when
the drift reverts to zero are related to the E4 device having been reconnected to the Android
