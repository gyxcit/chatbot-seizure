Project description: This project aims to compare and evaluate the performance of
two prominent deep learning architectures, ResNet and YOLO, for detecting objects,
scenes, and humans in real-time video streams from ambient environments. The
objective is to achieve a system capable of generating contextualized outputs like
"working in kitchen," "2 humans at a table," or "bottle of water on the table," by labeling
multiple objects and recognizing activities within a scene.
The study involves designing a comprehensive benchmarking framework to test both
models under various conditions, including different lighting, object arrangements, and
