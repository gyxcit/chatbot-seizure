is even more heterogeneous. At the same time, there are also less published studies investi-
gating the wearable non-EEG detection of exclusively FSs, as compared to studies including
TCSs. Furthermore, current work generally does not highlight the need for, and utility of, in-
dividualizeddetectionmodels. Thus,theanalysesincludedinthisthesis,specificallythework

the work presented here focuses on seizures with epileptic movements, it could also be used
similarly for non-motor FSs, possibly with a different combination of biosignals that omits
