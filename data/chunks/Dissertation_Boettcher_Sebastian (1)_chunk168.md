Figure 2.5: Performance of tonic-clonic seizure (TCS) detection in related work, grouped
by biosignal modality used in the detection model. “Multimodal” represents studies using
multipledifferentcombinationsofthebiosignalsaccelerometry(ACC),electrodermalactivity
(EDA), heart rate (HR), and electromyography (EMG) for their seizure detection. Data taken
fromNaganuretal.[108].
SD:standarddeviation.
