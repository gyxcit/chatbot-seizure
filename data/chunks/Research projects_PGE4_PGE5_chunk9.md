Project Title: Preprocessing Radiology Imaging for Veterinary Diagnostics Using Large
Language Models
Supervisor: Doreid Ammar, Anuradha Kar
Brief description: This project focuses on enhancing diagnostic capabilities in
veterinary medicine by combining advanced image preprocessing techniques with a
Large Language Model (LLM) to generate detailed medical reports from radiology
images. The initiative addresses the need for accurate and efficient analysis of pet
