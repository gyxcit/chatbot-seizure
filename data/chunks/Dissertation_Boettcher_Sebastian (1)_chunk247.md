time, up to several seconds of inaccuracy over several hours of recording. Therefore, it is
advisable to repeat the synchronization process periodically during the recording. The auto-

every few minutes. Another method to deal with drifting timestamps directly is to measure
individual calibration parameters for each device that is used in a study. Thereby, the precise
sampling rate for a device is found by a calibration procedure, to a degree of accuracy that
allows for a later recalibration of the timestamps in the recorded signals. Synchronizing the
