of parameters in structures such as AEs. These two reasons make their combination
suitable for many tasks such as unsupervised feature extraction for epileptic seizure
detection. AnovelapproachbasedonCNN-AEwaspresentedbyYuanetal.[136]. At
thefeatureextractionstage,twodeepapproaches,AEand2D-CNN,wereusedtoextract
thesupervisedandunsupervisedfeatures,respectively. Theunsupervisedfeatureswere
obtaineddirectlyfromtheinputsignals,andthesupervisedfeatureswereacquiredfrom
thespectrogramofthesignals. Finally,theSoftmaxclassifierwasutilizedforclassification
and achieved 94.37% accuracy. In another investigation, Yuan et al. [137] proposed an
