the detection methodology presented here in Section 4.1, some further feature engineering
work and subsequent model optimization would be necessary to transform it into a system
suitedforaSUDEPwarningsystem. Inparticular,theEDAfeatureswouldneedtobechanged,
specifically the long window duration as mentioned above. This would likely involve taking
into account only the quick response to a peak value and not the slow minute-long decline
back to a baseline. That is to say, such a lower-latency detection system seems to be within
