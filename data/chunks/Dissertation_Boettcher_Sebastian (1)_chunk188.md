2.3.3 Focal Non-Motor and Other Seizures
To date there is only sporadic research specifically investigating the detection of non-motor
FSs with wearables. Some studies include these seizure types as a subset, sometimes more
as an aside to convulsive seizures than their own seizure type. Not only is the detection of
non-motor seizures an inherently more difficult task, but there is also less immediate need
in general for a robust detection system for these seizures, as opposed to convulsive seizures
