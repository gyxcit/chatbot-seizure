brain's response to treatments like anesthetic infusion rates, facilitating precise control and optimizing
therapy delivery [50]. Through the integration of real-time tracking of these variabilities, closed-loop
systems can heighten control precision, enhance clinical feasibility, and minimize interruptions in therapy
