data. The goal is to enhance understanding of human behavior in everyday
environments, leveraging temporal data such as videos of prior activities or trajectories
of movement. By integrating historical activity patterns, the project aims to enable
accurate predictions of future actions, a capability with applications in areas like
healthcare, smart homes, and human-computer interaction.
The study involves a benchmarking exercise to evaluate state-of-the-art predictive
models, with a particular emphasis on FutureGAN, a generative adversarial network
designed for future action prediction. FutureGAN operates by learning spatiotemporal
