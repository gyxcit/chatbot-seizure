Key objectives include improving the model’s diagnostic accuracy, reducing false
positives/negatives, and ensuring interpretability to gain the trust of healthcare
professionals. The system also aims to support real-time analysis of X-ray images,
making it a valuable tool in busy clinical settings.
● Expected outcomes: The expected outcomes of this project include the
development of a deep learning-based X-ray analysis system capable of
accurately detecting and classifying abnormalities such as fractures, tumors, and
lung diseases. The system is expected to significantly reduce diagnostic time and
enhance the accuracy of interpretations, minimizing false positives and
