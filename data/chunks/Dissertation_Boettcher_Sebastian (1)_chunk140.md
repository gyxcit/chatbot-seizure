trical circuit. If the sensor begins to move in the direction of its free axis, inertia compels
the proof mass to lag behind the fixed part of the sensor, which is measurable as a change
of capacitance. To achieve three-axis accelerometers, either three such sensors are combined
in one package, one in every direction in three-dimensional space, or in more complex chips
a single proof mass is used with a series of springs providing the necessary degrees of free-
