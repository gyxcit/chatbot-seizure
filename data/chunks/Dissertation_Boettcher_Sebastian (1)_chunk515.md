Thereby, the model was trained on the data of all but one seizure and the respective peri-
ictal data, and tested on all remaining data including the left-out seizure for that participant,
minus the training data. This was repeated for all seizures, and the performance scores were
averaged. This procedure was then repeated for each combination of parameters. For the
inter-subject evaluation, a similar procedure was implemented for the three selected partici-
