application synthesizing symptomatic health data gleaned from wearable smartwatches [25]. Wearable
technology endeavors to enrich lifestyles by mining physiological conditions data. Integral to this process is
developing software algorithms essential for interpreting raw data from wearables, thus facilitating accurate
diagnoses and furnishing personalized recommendations grounded in peer group comparisons [26].
Compelling visualizations are pivotal in unearthing pertinent health patterns from multi-sensor real-time
wearable devices capturing vital data. This iterative process aids in deciphering health patterns and making
