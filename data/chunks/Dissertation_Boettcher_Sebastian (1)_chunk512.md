three or more seizures recorded, selected in the first step, were used to validate the per-
formance on data from all the remaining participants with one or two focal motor seizures
recorded. Thereby, the model was first parameter-optimized in a leave-one-participant-out
(LOPO) cross-validation on those training participants. Thus, each of the participants in this
optimization set was omitted from the model training process once and used as a validation
dataset. Themeanperformancescoresoverthecross-validationrunswerethenusedtodeter-
