machine learning problems [95]. To tackle this tuning effort, a hyperparameter optimization
was performed over several of the model parameters in a leave-one-participant-out (LOPO)
manner. To this end, the data set was split into a training set and a test set. The training set
consisted of the 10min peri-ictal data of 10 TCSs from 8 patients with epilepsy recruited at
theFreiburgsite. Thebasictestsetconsistedofthecompletedatafrom2patients,1fromthe
Freiburgsiteand1fromtheLondonsitewith11TCSs(seeSection4.1.3). Thehyperparameter
optimization only used the training set to keep the test set unknown to the model before
