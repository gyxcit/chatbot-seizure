performances, facilitating a placement of the results included in the following two chapters
within the state-of-the-art. Concluding from current developments in the field, the detec-
tion of epileptic seizures with low-profile, low-cost, non-EEG wearables is a very promising
approach, and the research presented in this thesis takes a meaningful step towards robust
detectionsystems.3
