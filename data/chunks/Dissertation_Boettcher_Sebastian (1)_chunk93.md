NearestNeighbor: This algorithm compares data samples by some distance metric and se-
lects a class according to the training samples nearest to the input sample. Like most
supervised classifiers, it relies on sensible feature engineering and parameter tuning
to achieve good performances. Dimensionality reduction is another preprocessing step
