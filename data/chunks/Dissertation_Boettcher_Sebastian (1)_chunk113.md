This thesis investigates seizure detection in automated seizure diaries for ultra-long-term
epilepsy monitoring with wearables. The primary methodology for monitoring epilepsy and
seizures in an ambulatory setting in clinical use is record-keeping in manual seizure diaries
(Section1.1.3). Manualseizurediaries,however,arehighlyunreliable[54,102](Figure1.5). Es-
