sometimes be referred to as BVP in literature, and in this thesis the term BVP is used for the

Because the raw output signal of a PPG sensor is a function of the amount of light falling
intothephotoelectricsensor,externallightcontaminatingthereflectedlightfromthesensorâ€™s
LED can heavily skew this signal [136, 160, 173]. This signal corruption is especially critical2.2. BIOSIGNALMODALITIES 31
