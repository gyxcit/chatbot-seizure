the range of >1Hz. Connection loss of the electrodes to the skin due to, for example, body
motion often causes artifacts in the EDA signal [158]. In these cases, the output signal will
show a sharp decrease or increase within just a few samples or fall to a minimum/zero-line
valuealtogether. Simplethresholdingorananalysisoftherateofamplitudechangecandetect
