importance for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy [15]. Furthermore, wearable systems are being crafted to
predict epileptic seizures by detecting anomalies in heart rate variability, showcasing the potential for non-
invasive predictive methods that can be seamlessly integrated into smart devices and mobile phones [21].
Additionally, research has demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing deep learning models to automatically
detect seizures and classify seizure types based on EEG data, laying the groundwork for more accurate and
tailored seizure management strategies [15]. In summary, these advancements underscore the promising
