real-time data-tracking capabilities contributing to health monitoring and physical performance
optimization in sports industries [9]. In addition, they offer immersive gaming experiences through devices
like VR headsets and haptic technology [9]. The fashion industry has also embraced wearable technology
with innovations like smart jackets that regulate body temperature based on sensors and smart rings that
track steps or sleep patterns [9]. Types of wearables are shown in Figure 1.
