● Non-EEG approaches reduce the emotional burden of frequent hospital
visits.
● Patients can be monitored remotely, leading to better mental well-being.2. Technological Factors (AI, ML, and Sensor-Driven Reasons)
A. Portability & Wearable Integration
● EEG requires fixed lab-based setups, while non-EEG methods integrate
with wearables and IoT devices (e.g., smartwatches, fitness bands).
B. Robustness Against Artifacts & Movement
● EEG signals are highly susceptible to motion artifacts.
● ECG, accelerometers, and PPG signals are more stable in daily activities.
C. Multimodal Sensor Fusion
● AI can combine multiple non-EEG signals (e.g., heart rate, skin
