context-aware scene descriptions by integrating object and human detection outputs will
be assessed.
● Expected outcomes:The outcome of the project is a detailed comparison
highlighting the strengths and limitations of each model for real-time applications.
This will help inform the selection of the most suitable model for tasks requiring
detailed scene understanding in domains like smart homes, surveillance, and
human-computer interaction..
● Required skills or prerequisites (if any): Python, deep learning, object
