utilization of wearable sensors and machine-learning algorithms for seizure detection [15]. These devices
can identify anomalies in physiological signals, such as alterations in heart rate, skin conductance, or
acceleration, signaling the onset of a seizure [12]. Overall, wearable devices hold promise in furnishing
personalized prediction mechanisms for seizure detection and forecasting, thereby substantially enhancing
the quality of life for individuals with epilepsy through early detection, intervention, and personalized
treatment strategies [24].
