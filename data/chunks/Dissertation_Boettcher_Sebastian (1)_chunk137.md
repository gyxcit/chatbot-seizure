This section highlights some of the biosignal modalities that can be used for monitoring
epilepsy and seizures, and outlines the working principles of the respective sensors. Specifi-
cally, information on the four main biosignal modalities captured by the Empatica E4 device
iscompiled(seealsoSection3.2.1). Figure2.2givesabriefoverviewofsomeofthesemodali-
