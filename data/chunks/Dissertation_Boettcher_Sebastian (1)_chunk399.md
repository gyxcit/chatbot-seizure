5s. The algorithm then marks the “end” of the post-ictal ACC silence if the moving standard
deviation was ≥ 0.2 for at least 5s. Thereby, the duration of the post-ictal ACC silence was
calculated. The moving standard deviation was calculated over a 5s window with maximal
overlap.
Electrodermal Activity: The EDA was plotted around the seizure for visual inspection.
