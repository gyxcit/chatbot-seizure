relationship between the duration of post-ictal ACC silence and categorical seizure-specific
variables were also analyzed. The post-ictal ACC silence was longer in seizures followed by
PGES (adjusted P = .05), in seizures presenting a higher risk of SUDEP (PGES â‰¥20s; ad-
justed P = .037) and in seizures showing an EDA response (adjusted P = .038), the latter
also showed longer PGES durations (adjusted P = .004). There was no association with con-
