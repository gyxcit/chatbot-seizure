correlation between PGES and PI durations. These findings are consistent with, and repli-
cate, previous studies analyzing the relationship between PI and PGES, where seizures asso-
ciated with PGES had a longer duration of immobility as compared to those not followed by
PGES[318,319].

The lack of association between PI and seizure duration was first reported by Gowers [335]
in 1881 and confirmed in later studies [320, 321]. With some exceptions [322], additional
