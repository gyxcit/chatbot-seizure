mine the optimal parameter combination. In a second evaluation step, the optimized model,
now trained with all the peri-ictal seizure data from the training subjects, was then applied
to all the data from the test set participants. During the training of this model, the data were
again first standardized using the z-score method, and those normalization parameters were
