seizures.
Due to their typically short duration of just a few seconds and low movement profile of
slight jerks of a body part, myoclonic FSs are some of the hardest epileptic seizure types to
detect from wearable device data. Thus, research investigating this problem is sporadic at
best. Hypp√∂nenetal.[232],forexample,developavideo-baseddetectionsystemfortheeval-

amplitude and frequency, estimated from optical flow of the video. They report a high level
