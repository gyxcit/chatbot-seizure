preceding a seizure [21]. This system has yielded promising outcomes in predicting seizures based on HRV
data. Another approach entails leveraging wearable technology to anticipate seizure likelihood by analyzing
biomarkers indicative of seizure and epileptic activity cycles. For instance, heart rate and temperature may
be biomarkers for seizure cycles [24]. Seizures have been observed to synchronize with underlying circadian
and multiday cycles in heart rate, suggesting a propensity for seizures to occur at specific phases of
individual-specific heart rate cycles [24]. In addition to HRV analysis, researchers have explored the
