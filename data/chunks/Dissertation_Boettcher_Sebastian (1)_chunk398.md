Automatic Detection of Post-Ictal ACC Silence: The ACC data immediately around the
seizureeventwereplottedandvisuallyinspected. Theinformationobtainedfromtheplotswas
used to create an algorithm for the automatic detection of the post-ictal ACC silence. Given
the seizure offset marked by clinical experts, the post-ictal ACC silence detection algorithm
markedthe“start”ofthepost-ictalACCsilenceifthemovingstandarddeviationwas< 0.2for
5s. The algorithm then marks the “end” of the post-ictal ACC silence if the moving standard
