most convulsive seizures do not lead to SUDEP and the occurrence of a fatal seizure is un-
predictable, the automatic, continuous, long-term identification of risk factors for SUDEP as-
sociated with each individual seizure assumes great clinical importance. In a population at
high risk of SUDEP, this study aims to assess whether ACC could be used as a reliable digital
