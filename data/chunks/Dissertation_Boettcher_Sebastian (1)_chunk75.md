reasons.
Consumer-grade wearables and similar devices, however, most often record signals with-
out the use of electrodes and wires. Thereby, sensors frequently target different aspects of
the autonomic nervous system (ANS), with biosignal modalities such as electrodermal activ-
ity(EDA),photoplethysmography(PPG)1,andskintemperature(TMP).Moreover,modalities
such as accelerometry (ACC) and gyroscopy measure the motion of body parts. Section 2.2
goes into further detail regarding these biosignal modalities. A notable difference between
electrographic and wearable biosignal modalities is the variety of the sample rates at which
