Wearable Devices Data: Raw data from the wrist-worn wearable device (Empatica E4)
were streamed via Bluetooth to an android app during the recordings and collected on a cen-
tralized data server [291], as described in Section 3.2. Raw data from the upper arm device
(IMEC armband) were transferred directly from the device to a laptop via cable at the end of
the recording. Both devices and the vEEG were synchronized with a timeserver at the begin-
