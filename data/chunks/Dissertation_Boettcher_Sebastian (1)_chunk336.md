(c) The SCRR was calculated as the number of threshold crossings of the first deriva-

ToaccommodatethedifferentwindowsizesoverwhichtheACCandEDAfeaturesarecal-
culated, a fixed interval between feature window applications was applied. Thus, all features
are calculated at fixed time points, with their respective windows centered on each consecu-
tive point, creating the same number of feature vectors for both the ACC and EDA features
