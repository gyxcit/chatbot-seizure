The Empatica E4 is a research-grade wrist-worn wearable certified as a medical device
for epilepsy monitoring, and provides access to the raw data of the biosignal modalities ac-
celerometry, electrodermal activity, and blood volume pulse (BVP), which were used in the
seizure detection methodologies presented here. Study participants also underwent video-e-
lectroencephalography (vEEG) monitoring at the two epilepsy centers the studies were con-
ducted at. Epileptologists created expert annotations of seizure onset and offset times as well
as type and included semiologies, serving as a ground truth for the evaluation of the seizure
