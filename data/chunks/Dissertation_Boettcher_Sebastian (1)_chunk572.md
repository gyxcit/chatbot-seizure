Seizure detection for focal onset seizures without generalization by means of wearable non-
EEG devices is a so far little-researched problem. This study demonstrated that for those
seizures in this category with tonic or clonic movements, that is, those closest in semiology
to generalized tonic-clonic seizures, robustly detecting seizures from wearable data may be
possible for individual patients with epilepsy, depending on their specific seizure manifesta-
tion. Overall, electrodermal activity signals seem to provide the most informative features
for seizure detection, suggesting it to be an essential part of any future seizure detection re-
