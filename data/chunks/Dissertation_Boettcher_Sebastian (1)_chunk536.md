The sole data set from the KCL site, KCL1, had three seizures recorded that match the
criteria for the seizure type. The motor manifestations for them were more heterogeneous
than for the other two participants. All had tonic components, but there were also some oral
automatisms, and one seizure also had clonic components. Furthermore, one seizure did not
prompt ictal tachycardia, and there was a high variance between the seizure durations, with
onebeingover2minandoccurringwhileawake,andtheothertwoonly22s,occurringfrom
sleep.
Aside from the movements during the seizures, Figure 5.7 also gives a good overview of
